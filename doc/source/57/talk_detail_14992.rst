OpenStack is not a thing... and this is why...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will talk about the current state of OpenStack and discuss various events/actions within the OpenStack community as well as news articles that may shed new light as to OpenStack's future. There has been a dramatic shift in the past year with the adoption rate and companies actively contributing to the project. We are going to sift through the noise and get the real pulse on OpenStack.
