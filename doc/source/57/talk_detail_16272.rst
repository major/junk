The Enterprise WG Workload Reference Architectures for OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Enterprise Work Group has been working with Enterprise organizations to understand their requirements for deploying OpenStack based clouds. One thing we've heard repeatedly is the need for Reference Architectures to support development plans and deployment strategies. The team has started creating multiple Workload Reference Architectures targeting different use cases. Building upon our successful presentation in Austin, In this session we will cover What is a Workload Reference Architecture? Why are we creating the Reference Architectures?   What is our current status? How can you get involved? This work is a collaboration from the Enterprise Working Group community. This session focuses on the development sample Reference Architectures which are intended to help reduce barriers for enterprise cloud adoption.
