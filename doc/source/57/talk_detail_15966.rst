There are always alternatives! OpenStack as a component of a larger strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Very often OpenStack is viewed as the foundation and basis for a cloud strategy with the components that ship as part of the big tent often considered the only solution for some of the requirements and OpenStack as a platform getting rejected if one of these components doesn’t fit our needs. This should never be the case with a platform that is built on open API’s and extensibility. There are always alternatives!In this talk we look at how OpenStack exists a small piece of a much larger IT strategy and how existing enterprise tool sets can be integrated and drive the adoption and operational capability of an OpenStack cloud platform.
