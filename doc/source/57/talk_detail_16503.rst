Making the Grade: Cloud Thrives in the API Economy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Modern organizations rely on many applications; levels of integration tighten across platforms, solutions offer a progressively complex ecosphere of business processes, services, and endpoints. This is a force behind businesses adoption of cloud computing. The strength of cloud is the Application Programing Interface (API); it permeates existing and new services, it offers opportunity for innovation with advanced technology along with new monetary prospects. APIs are enablement tools; by encapsulating transaction processes and integrating communication across a disparately wide ecosystem of diverse technology solutions. Strategically, APIs may seem like a silver bullet but it requires planning and effort to achieve nirvana. Start with evaluation of the business needs. Understand existing technology asset inventories to determine what is cloud-ready, cloud capable, and what can be transformed as well as the hard decision about what gets left behind.
