Turn-key OpenStack - improving economics and operations with a hosted model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Abstract While organizations everywhere gravitate towards OpenStack for their private clouds, taking talented engineers off of revenue generating activities is bad for business. Coupling that with an industry-wide OpenStack skill shortage along with capital constraints results in a classic outsourcing dilemma. The good news is that customers can now obtain private OpenStack deployments! QTS Data Centers and Canonical have teamed up to provide hosted private OpenStack clouds, custom-built to client technology specifications and OPEX budgets.  As a large scale data center and cloud provider, QTS hosts complex hybrid IT and cloud workloads, and works with open source software leader, Canonical, to deliver hosted OpenStack!
