Using OpenStack Neutron to escape vendor lock-In
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Planning to run 15.000 Neutron Networks in a single region? Large scale Neutron deployments require careful planning and consideration when it comes to technologies and protocols involved. Learn how SAP leverages OpenStack Neutron with Hierarchical Port Binding to scale its datacenter networks. This approach helps SAP's Converged Cloud platform to support Multi-Hypervisor, Bare Metal computing, Manila shares and Neutron advanced services all in the same network. See how Neutron helped us to encapsulate vendor specifics into drivers which enabled SAP to design a true Multi-Vendor architecture where Vendor decisions don't ultimately lead to Vendor Lock-In.
