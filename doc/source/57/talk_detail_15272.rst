**Abstract:**

Major enterprise customers continue to have and make significant investments in the mainframe to support both legacy applications, and increasingly, next gen workloads thanks to the high levels of virtualization the mainframe can support. In this talk, we explore the benefits of adding the mainframe to you hypervisor mix and demonstrate deploying workloads in a multi-hypervisor environment.
