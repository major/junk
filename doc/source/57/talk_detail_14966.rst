Things to consider while building an OpenStack cloud.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is ready for enterprise workloads. But it is not an easy process to move organizations to a new technology. This could be due to the complexity of IT processes and emerging technologies. Architects and IT teams tasked with designing and deploying OpenStack clouds could face multiple challenges that impact the result of a successful deployment. In this session, we will discuss what you need to consider before and during an OpenStack cloud deployment.
