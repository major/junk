Is OpenStack ready for Pets (Traditional Enterprise Workloads)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises today run most of their business on existing traditional applications. Re-designing these applications for cloud computing is a trans-formative journey that could yield significant benefits, though would take significant time and investment that most enterprises don’t have the luxury of.So enterprises are looking at migrating traditional workloads from their existing environments to an unified cloud environment. In the last few releases, OpenStack has moved the needle in the right direction to enable enterprise workloads in the cloud. In this presentation, we will explore how OpenStack addresses or plans-to-address the following four aspects that come up on top in our customer conversations - Deployment - Storage- High Performance and Scale- Business Continuity
