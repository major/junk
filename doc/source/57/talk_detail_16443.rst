PayPal Cloud Journey: From Zero to 100% Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

PayPal decided to go with OpenStack as "Cloud Operating System" in 2012 after a very careful evaluation. Now, we are very happy and proud that we took the right decision 4 years back.  Our deployment footprint is one of the largest OpenStack Private Cloud in the world with 13 Availability Zones hosting 10,000+ hypervisors with 400,000+ cores, 150,000 VMs and petabytes of block storage. It is hosting 100% Production workloads except DBs and Hadoop. We are working towards moving Data tier to Cloud. In this 4 years of journey, we learnt so many lessons and several USA/Canada based enterprises reached out to PayPal Cloud team to get insights about our experience. So, we thought of using this forum to share "under the hood" details for benefiting the enterpries across the globe that are operating the cloud already or about to make decision on Cloud OS.
