Transformation : the challenge for IT teams with existing systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will look at the main transformation patterns to Hybrid IT and the main transformation paths taken by IT teams, technical considerations (constraints, building blocks -IBM or not-), and  organization/governance impacts. We will look at the multiple Open-Stack options some not known by many, that are available to manage IBM systems and their different types of hypervisors (and will explain why keep them). We will finally discuss the ROI, how are different IT sizes influence the technical choices taken.
