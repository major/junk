Not just code: what the OpenStack community can teach you on development and IT management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Large open source communities, and specifically the OpenStack community, have a common set of rules and processes that enable a diverse set of contributors to collaborate and deliver code efficiently. We usually take these rules and processes for granted, but a fresh look can provide valuable advice on good practices for any organization. In this session, we will discuss the do's and dont's of efficient collaboration around software development and IT systems management, as seen by two former IT Architects who have now learnt a lot by developing inside the OpenStack community.


* **Francisco Javier Pe√±a** *(Javier has been involved in the creation of solutions based on Open Source components for more than ten years. Before joining the OpenStack Engineering team at Red Hat, he helped customers design and build clouds based on OpenStack. Now he is contributing to the RDO community by working on the continuous packaging pipeline, the OpenStack Puppet modules and Packstack installer, and he is also involved in the definition of highly available architectures for OpenStack deployments (https://github.com/beekhof/osp-ha-deploy/blob/master/HA-keepalived.md).)*

* **Alfredo Moralejo** *(Alfredo Moralejo is a long-time IT infrastructure specialist with proven experience in the adoption of OpenSource technologies in the enterprise. As part of the Red Hat Consulting team, Alfredo has participated in the design and implementation of OpenStack-based cloud environments for different customers. In the last year he has been working in the RDO team as OpenStack packages maintainer. You can find Alfredo in #rdo channel in freenode.)*
