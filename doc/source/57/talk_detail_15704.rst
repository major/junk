A Tale of Deploy Tools - Choosing The Right OpenStack Deployment Tool For You (and Your Users)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

They say knowing is half the battle, but when it comes to OpenStack deployment tools it can certainly seem like more than that. Deciding which tool is the right one is challenging for both operators deploying clouds and developers looking to integrate upstream. In this session we work to cut through the noise and provide our view of the ups and downs of a few major upstream deployment tools such as Ansible, Chef and Puppet - as well as some of the OpenStack Deployment projects that use them. Along the way we'll share our experiences both picking a tool to support and contributing back to OpenStack-Ansible to create value for us and the upstream community.
