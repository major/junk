The good, the bad and the ugly about running OpenStack as a production platform in a public cloud.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

City Network decided to go all in on OpenStack. We will share in the experience of deploying the first 1000 customers to earning the first million euros. Building out across the globe and keeping customers happy while overcoming the challenges and taking advantage of the possibilities of OpenStack. It hasÂ not always been easy - but was it worth it? 3 years into production with OpenStack - what has been good? What has been bad? And what is just ugly?
