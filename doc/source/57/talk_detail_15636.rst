Project management for an OpenStack deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, we’ll review the process of managing an OpenStack deployment project -- from potential opportunity through discovery workshop, planning and implementation phases, and post-deployment activities. We’ll discuss the best practices and project management tools used to gather requirements, control the scope, manage participation from key players, and deliver a successful deployment. This session is based on experiences gathered from managing multiple successful OpenStack deployments -- from small and quick projects to large, multi-product private and hybrid cloud solutions.
