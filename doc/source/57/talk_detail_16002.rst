**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a powerful IaaS cloud engine. However, to manage the evolution of your cloud to its full maturity and keep its total cost of ownership under control, OpenStack native management tools must be coupled with more sophisticated automation and governance tools. This session will explore the maturity stages of an OpenStack cloud as it grows in scale and complexity, providing guidance on the key areas to focus on for a successful implementation.
