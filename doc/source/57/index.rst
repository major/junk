Nurturing your OpenStack. PaaS and CMP, proteins and vitamins for your IaaS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is already being deployed almost everywhere, however, not in many enterprises the value that IaaS provides is being obtained. Testing environments, basic big data workloads or niche workloads, such as SSL frontend offloading, are the most widespread uses it is receiving. It is possible to add muscle to your deployment by addressing an important wide number of use cases by deploying OpenShift as a PaaS on top of your OpenStack adding more muscle to it. To achieve better integration among PaaS and IaaS, and at the very same time reach legacy systems and increase control and management a Cloud Management Platform can provide the vitamins needed to enhance the IaaS capabilities, make it stretch beyond its current reach and keep it healthy and under control.

Go below the surface of the Iceberg : IBM Systems strategy with OpenStack update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will discuss the IBM systems support of Open Stack, from what are the IBM systems to how OS is supported.Since many yeasr IBM has been a strong supporter of Open Stack in terms of software investment, but most people may have missed the internal change that happened to have all IBM systems support OpenStack, as controlled nodes (or controllers), providing OpenSTack APIs to any used willing to transform their existing systems to a OpenStack self-service IT without loosing the benefits of their existing investments. We will review how this transformation was made , the recent changes, what systems can be intregrated how, and discuss evolutions coming from client requests. This is right middle of the hybrid cloud solutions: vertical hybrids, horizontal hybrids… and the concepts of using different infrastructures for different tasks: why clients want to do this ?

Push-button Deployment of Oracle Applications and Database with OpenStack Murano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditional enterprise software deployment can be complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.  OpenStack services provide a rich set of capabilities for automated deployment and configuration of raw compute, network, and storage, but have typically left the top of the stack to be managed by traditional configuration management (CM) tooling.  With OpenStack Murano's abstraction capabilities, deployment time can be reduced from weeks and days to hours and minutes, without the requirement to develop and maintain highly customized CM manifests.  Oracle is focused on enabling sophisticated enterprise applications from the OpenStack Murano Application Catalog with pre-configured, pre-tested templates.  In this session, Oracle experts will demonstrate how we have configured and deployed Oracle Database in our test environments using these templates and the Murano Application Catalog and how it can be incorporated into multi-tiered application stacks.

Cloud Strategies for Greater Business Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Working with International Data Corporation (IDC), we have analyzed over 6100 organizations across 31 countries. This massive body of research has allowed us to distill the latest cloud market trends. We have also been able to correlate progressive adoption of cloud technologies (private, public or hybrid) with business outcomes and measured the impact that optimized cloud strategies can have on a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). To make this information actionable we have developed the Cisco Business Cloud Advisor (BCA) framework, which allows you to evaluate cloud environments following proven vendor agnostic methodologies. The intent is to provide concrete guidance on what you need to do to implement the right cloud strategy for your business. During this session we will review some of the market research findings and discuss the Cisco BCA framework components and deliverables that can help you continuously optimize your cloud environments.

Anti-Pattern Bingo: Enabling Stateful Windows Desktops in an OpenStack fabric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Can you take advantage of all of our investment in an OpenStack cloud for running persistent Windows VDI, one of the most cloud-foreign workloads available? What are the opportunities you would gain and do they outweigh the problems you will create?  How can you compare this offering against an alternative engineered solution or an existing business deployment?  Does the customer have to change their preferred tools for consuming this solution or can they integrate those into this new offering? If we embrace diversity in our platform can we support some of the most inelastic, fragile, stateful and tightly coupled services that are run today without compromising the integrity of our cloud.

Fitting OpenStack into your environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When we first test and pilot OpenStack, it often runs in isolation in a separate infrastructure -- i.e., "shadowed" IT. However, as we expand the scope of OpenStack deployment and start to use it in production, it needs to work with your existing operation tools and process and within your existing infrastructure. In this session, we’ll look at how we can fit OpenStack into your IT environment. We’ll also provide management views into both OpenStack and other infrastructure managers, such as vCenter, etc. You’ll also see a demo of how we provide a management view to help manage and automate OpenStack with other infrastructure components.

OpenStack in the Wild! How to make OpenStack a reality in your company.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The advantages of OpenStack in the enterprise are well-documented: agility, flexibility, lack of vendor lock-in, focus on enterprise applications vs. infrastructure, etc. But the reality is that despite great advancements, OpenStack remains challenging for most organizations to implement. Stories of the Fortune 100 adopting OpenStack are inspirational, but many organizations lack the resources to successfully deploy OpenStack. This is compounded by a complex ecosystem--finding your way and getting started is tough enough! This session is designed for the enterprise IT leader evaluating the merits of OpenStack and considering implementing this transformational technology within their organization. We will examine the principal methods of consumption (appliance, distribution, hosted service, etc) and the pros and cons associated with each. Attendees will leave the session with tangible action items they can take back and get started with.

Big Data Orchestration: Make the Cloud Ready for IoT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are Big Data systems ready for the cloud? Aren't they just pet applications? Big Data systems are among the most demanding applications that can be run on a IaaS Cloud platform. They have special requirements for storage and network in particular and react sensitive on latency and bandwidth variations. A possible solution would be to consume Big Data as a Service, but this lacks security and flexibility, making it necessary for tenants to setup and operate their big data processing systems on their own. Running it within the cloud as a virtualized workload seems like the way to go, but it poses real challenges to cloud orchestration systems, because of it's special needs. This can result in subpar performance, because the placement of resources may not be optimal according to storage characteristics. This talk shows possible optimizations for OpenStack clouds and in particular how to optimize the orchestration of storage to fulfill the needed characteristics.

Opening Up the World.. Making the shift from traditional cloud to open
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The enterprise datacenter today is often full of closed source proprietary software and hardware solutions that have been built by a vendor ecosystem that told CIOs and IT Directors it would be easier.  Transitioning to an open-source based datacenter provides a broader ecosystem of support and options while still allowing for the features and functionaility that are needed to run the business.  Throughout this session we examine many of the components of the datacenter to include: Hypervisor Choice Storage Selection Networking Options Application Support Corporate Policy Transition Convincing the application owner Total Cost of Ownership analysis

Is OpenStack ready for Pets (Traditional Enterprise Workloads)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises today run most of their business on existing traditional applications. Re-designing these applications for cloud computing is a trans-formative journey that could yield significant benefits, though would take significant time and investment that most enterprises don’t have the luxury of.So enterprises are looking at migrating traditional workloads from their existing environments to an unified cloud environment. In the last few releases, OpenStack has moved the needle in the right direction to enable enterprise workloads in the cloud. In this presentation, we will explore how OpenStack addresses or plans-to-address the following four aspects that come up on top in our customer conversations - Deployment - Storage- High Performance and Scale- Business Continuity

IPv6: Is it finally that time? Complexity, risk and business impact.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Networking technology offers so many areas for advancement and investment, and so many demands on limited developer resources; So, why not put IPv6 deployment off for … just another six months? Two new entrants into the technology arena are Big Data and IoT. IoT Cloud is driving large-scale compute environments that may finally promote IPv6 from “that sounds great” to a mandatory RFP checkbox - for Telcos, Cloud Service Providers, and Enterprises alike.  While the promise of IPv6 has been clear for years, the reality of implementation will bring a new set of technical challenges, and require increased networking expertise and protocol knowledge from its implementers. In other words, it won’t be easy. A few topics we will explore in this session are: Cost of doing business in an IPv6 environment The impact of IPv6 adoption on the business of cloud provisioning The importance of an end-to-end IPv6 story for Cloud adoption

Beware the Pitfalls when migrating to Hybrid Cloud with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Companies are on longer asking if they should move to the cloud. They’re asking how to migrate to hybrid cloud with OpenStack. A hybrid cloud can offer a company the best of both public and private cloud, meet the requirements such as Cloud bursting, Disaster Recovery, Lifecycle-based Deployment, etc. But not if you slip into one of these pitfalls. Visibility: how to manage clouds with a single pane? Access Control: how to handle different credentials with security manner? Network Connectivity: how to manage network configurations and maintain connectivity across clouds? Outage & DR: how to ensure hybrid applications stay up during one cloud outages? Audit & Compliance: how to collect audit data and comply with regulations? Some OpenStack projects/features like tacker, tricircle, freezer, federated identity, sso, etc have collaborated to address these problems.

The Fall and Rise of Open Stack Cloud Appliances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are two trends effecting IT organization around Open Stack. The first is Open stack is evolving from it’s initial developer focus on “do-it-yourself” clouds to focusing on improving the operations and ROI of running Open Stack. The second trend is the rise of appliances (hyper-converged and converged infrastructures)  as a way IT and Business owners are consuming technology. Both trends are pushing for IT to provide faster services (provisioning, scaling, flash), self-service offerings, pushing against network, storage, virtualization/compute admin IT silos, and expecting dynamic on-demand scale at lower cost.

A Tale of Deploy Tools - Choosing The Right OpenStack Deployment Tool For You (and Your Users)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

They say knowing is half the battle, but when it comes to OpenStack deployment tools it can certainly seem like more than that. Deciding which tool is the right one is challenging for both operators deploying clouds and developers looking to integrate upstream. In this session we work to cut through the noise and provide our view of the ups and downs of a few major upstream deployment tools such as Ansible, Chef and Puppet - as well as some of the OpenStack Deployment projects that use them. Along the way we'll share our experiences both picking a tool to support and contributing back to OpenStack-Ansible to create value for us and the upstream community.

What Copel Telecom and I learned along the way to our first OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Copel is the largest company in Brazil's wealthy Paraná state, and its telecommunications subsidiary, Copel Telecom, delivers a broad range of connectivity and hosted services to its enterprise and increasingly consumer customer base. Cloud was the one key product they were missing from their portfolio. This is the story of how their first cloud came into existence, and what they learnt along the way. Highlights include:    - What do you do when you have an even number of datacenters (but still want HA)    - Coming to terms with the fact that physical hosts (and their VMs) may temporarily (or more permanently) disappear    - What moving from the appliance world to software-defined storage actually implies    - How to handle the fact nobody on your team has any OpenStack experience and more.

Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 1.5, Pets, Cattle: How to tame the menagerie with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises are faced with the challenge of embracing modern cloud native apps to stay competitive and deliver business value faster, while simultaneously having to maintain several traditional IT business critical apps. Keeping aside the discussion of whether we need 2 models of IT (Bimodal), the reality is that enterprises are looking for better automation and improved efficiency to be successful in the market. By supporting both traditional and modern cloud native apps, OpenStack can enable effective automation of both and possibly provide a path for migrating apps from the traditional model to the modern cloud native model. This talk will explore the various challenges that enterprises face today as they adopt the cloud native paradigm, propose how OpenStack can be used to address each of these challenges, provide concrete recommendations with use-cases and examples, and show a demo of how tools built on OpenStack can provide effective automation for traditional and modern apps.

Don't run your OpenStack as a cottage industry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Often when first setting a Private Cloud organisations are investigating the art of the possible and not necessarily thinking of the service going into full production, but ideally one should expect that investment to pay and soon be a harness carrying essential business services to deliver long term success. Once services do become production ready and bring value to organisations all the traditional concerns of the Operations teams suddenly start to matter, because even if your cloud services are highly dynamic and agile the infrastructure foundation needs to be ROCK solid. See how distribution vendors help you in the search for a platform which won't fear!

There are always alternatives! OpenStack as a component of a larger strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Very often OpenStack is viewed as the foundation and basis for a cloud strategy with the components that ship as part of the big tent often considered the only solution for some of the requirements and OpenStack as a platform getting rejected if one of these components doesn’t fit our needs. This should never be the case with a platform that is built on open API’s and extensibility. There are always alternatives!In this talk we look at how OpenStack exists a small piece of a much larger IT strategy and how existing enterprise tool sets can be integrated and drive the adoption and operational capability of an OpenStack cloud platform.

Why OpenStack distributions exist?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many OpenStack success stories out there, and we often hear about how a team inside a company deployed OpenStack and manages it on a daily basis. In the early days, and still to a large extent today, these success stories were always about the team deploying OpenStack on its own. This however hides the fact that a huge number of deployment are nowadays using OpenStack distributions. This session will explore the many reasons why OpenStack distributions exist, and why they should be considered in the enterprise world. Ease of deployment, supportability, certifications, knowledge of the vendor, etc. are just some of the benefits that come with an OpenStack distribution and that should be considered when deciding upon a company strategy around OpenStack.

“Zero tickets” deployment of applications and infrastructure in the Enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the main drivers for Cloud adoption in the enterprise is the desire to improve the time to market of new features being delivered by application teams. Cloud aims to address this need by automating the many manual processes necessary to deploy code in a legacy environment. Unfortunately, all too many Cloud deployments fail to adequately address this need. In a recent Gartner study on the causes of failure of enterprise Cloud programs, 95% of respondents indicated that they faced significant issues with their private cloud deployment, and 31% of respondents attributed the cause to a failure to change the operational model. In many cases, enterprises attempt to shoehorn Cloud into their existing ticket driven workflows and find that while certain manual tasks are automated, the overall time to market is not significantly decreased, primarily due to the time spent waiting on tickets to be actioned or approved

Turn-key OpenStack - improving economics and operations with a hosted model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Abstract While organizations everywhere gravitate towards OpenStack for their private clouds, taking talented engineers off of revenue generating activities is bad for business. Coupling that with an industry-wide OpenStack skill shortage along with capital constraints results in a classic outsourcing dilemma. The good news is that customers can now obtain private OpenStack deployments! QTS Data Centers and Canonical have teamed up to provide hosted private OpenStack clouds, custom-built to client technology specifications and OPEX budgets.  As a large scale data center and cloud provider, QTS hosts complex hybrid IT and cloud workloads, and works with open source software leader, Canonical, to deliver hosted OpenStack!

Application Development Strategies for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is uniquely positioned to offer a distributed application platform for ISVs to target new and existing applications for. With an ever growing catalog of public and private clouds using OpenStack, and a market forecasted to reach $2.7B by 2017, the OpenStack ecosystem presents a vast greenfield for application deployment. This presentation covers a number of strategies for bringing applications to OpenStack, including delivering applications on private OpenStack infrastructures for enterprise customers, hosting applications on public clouds, and delivering Software as a Service (SaaS) on private clouds. Drawing from a mix of real-world applications, analyst studies in application adoption trends, and application developer tools and best practices, you will leave this talk with an argument for the strategic importance of deploying your applications on OpenStack, and an understanding of the available tools to start building and porting your applications.

Navigating infrastructure choices: What workloads are best suited for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Confusion often emerges when decisions hinge on what workloads are ideally suited for OpenStack. Stateful versus Stateless? Traditional versus Cloud Native? Pets versus Cattle? Ephemeral versus long lasting? The choices get further complicated when considering the many infrastructure choices that exist - bare metal servers, virtualized infrastructure in the form of hypervisors, Linux containers, private clouds (e.g., OpenStack), and public clouds. Are all of these mutually exclusive? Are there architectures that should combine these choices - e.g., containers on Nova instances? In this session we will explore the solution use cases and the attributes that must be properly considered to identify when and where OpenStack makes the most sense. A decision framework will be presented to assist IT organizations in the workload mapping process that is a critical aspect of both architecture and infrastructure planning activities.

Is your cloud scaling forecast a bit foggy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack clouds are typically designed once and grown over time. There are different schools of thought about how growth is triggered and executed, but historically, a lot of guesswork is involved, especially in environments where change and procurement can not be run at a moment's notice. On the other hand, the OpenStack cloud provides a large amount of internal data, which is typically not seen by management, but allows forecasting of requirements for growth and change if harnessed correctly. This is where the new project WeatherStation comes in. Complementary to monitoring tools such as StackLight, WeatherStation provides management with the equivalent of the data the monitoring tool provides to the engineers and operators, but instead of an 'at the moment' view it focuses on forecasting using the relevant data to equip management with the necessary data to keep up with cloud growth and also provides relevant business data for future project decisions.

Escaping the Debt Monster: The Case for Creating an OpenStack Community Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the Lead over AT&T’s newly established “OpenStack Community Program” the presenter will explore the strategy for making the case to fund a team of upstream OpenStack Community Contributors and the resulting trials and travails of succeeding! We will cover key principals of the business case, strategy for getting 'buy in', communicating seemingly bizarre new concepts to executives (hint: use trendy buzz words) and the myriad challenges of ‘breaking new ground’. We will NOT cover the typical boring recruit, train, manage stuff. Rather, dotted with amusing anecdotes, we’ll explore the far more fascinating facets of the building phase like Intellectual Property Lawyers wanting to review every commit for ‘patent potential’, a Finance org that funds you with Capital $ (not Expense), never before considering that software which the company never owns, can’t be depreciated, or how to generate a ‘model driven estimate’ for a team that has NO deliverables beyond ‘growing their influence’!

Making the Grade: Cloud Thrives in the API Economy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Modern organizations rely on many applications; levels of integration tighten across platforms, solutions offer a progressively complex ecosphere of business processes, services, and endpoints. This is a force behind businesses adoption of cloud computing. The strength of cloud is the Application Programing Interface (API); it permeates existing and new services, it offers opportunity for innovation with advanced technology along with new monetary prospects. APIs are enablement tools; by encapsulating transaction processes and integrating communication across a disparately wide ecosystem of diverse technology solutions. Strategically, APIs may seem like a silver bullet but it requires planning and effort to achieve nirvana. Start with evaluation of the business needs. Understand existing technology asset inventories to determine what is cloud-ready, cloud capable, and what can be transformed as well as the hard decision about what gets left behind.

Defining the Common Operating Model enables the Cloud Management Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing the cloud requires adoption of a Common Operating Model (COM) that takes into consideration a multitude of factors such as the strategic vision and business priorities set forth by leadership. It also requires both business and technical architecture to translate the strategic vision into new solution capabilities and services in the cloud. Implementing a DevOps approach is fundamental for building cloud-native application workloads but it also breaks down the siloed organization trenches so that delivery is integrated and continuous. The COM promotes a service orientation to deliver operationally with greater agility and scalability, with minimal to no interruption, maximum control, and a strong performance orientation that meets the competitive market head on.
