Delivering the Full Value of OpenStack with a Bimodal or Multimodal IT Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has been broadly adopted for implementing mode 2 IT projects and is the ideal platform for new agile and innovative cloud workload development and DevOps. However, more and more enterprise users are seeing huge potential in OpenStack to help them drive efficiency improvements, better productivity and lower costs in their traditional mode 1 IT data center environments. In this session, we’ll explore OpenStack features that make it the perfect fit for a multi-modal IT strategy. We’ll explore how to make the most of a multi-hypervisor strategy, when and why advanced HA features make sense and discuss real-world examples of data center modernization delivered by OpenStack projects.
