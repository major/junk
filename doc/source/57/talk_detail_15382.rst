Opening Up the World.. Making the shift from traditional cloud to open
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The enterprise datacenter today is often full of closed source proprietary software and hardware solutions that have been built by a vendor ecosystem that told CIOs and IT Directors it would be easier.  Transitioning to an open-source based datacenter provides a broader ecosystem of support and options while still allowing for the features and functionaility that are needed to run the business.  Throughout this session we examine many of the components of the datacenter to include: Hypervisor Choice Storage Selection Networking Options Application Support Corporate Policy Transition Convincing the application owner Total Cost of Ownership analysis
