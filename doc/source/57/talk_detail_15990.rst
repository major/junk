~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In order to achieve the intended benefit for your organization when adopting OpenStack, it is crucial to establish business-IT alignment. This session will focus on lessons learned about the relationship between business and IT and show how a successful alignment enables organizations to accelerate their business with OpenStack based on a case study. This case study is about a service provider that is part of Cloud 28+ and provides attendees with a more realistic view on total cost of ownership, amount of license cost and increase in volume of services. This knowledge will help you to avoid common pitfalls, drive the success of your OpenStack project and support the achievement of ambitious goals like the reduction of costs and time to market.
