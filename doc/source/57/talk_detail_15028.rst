Elephant in the Room: What's the TCO for an OpenStack cloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Starting with a total cost of ownership (TCO) of an OpenStack cloud, we examine the strategic tuning knobs you have available to provide the best solution for your organization. We will introduce the TCO model, as well as using standard financial accounting practices to build a basis for calculating the hidden costs of your OpenStack cloud. The presentation will provide a basic overview of the accounting principles required, but to get the most out of the model, it helps if you share and talk through with your finance team.
