Application Development Strategies for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is uniquely positioned to offer a distributed application platform for ISVs to target new and existing applications for. With an ever growing catalog of public and private clouds using OpenStack, and a market forecasted to reach $2.7B by 2017, the OpenStack ecosystem presents a vast greenfield for application deployment. This presentation covers a number of strategies for bringing applications to OpenStack, including delivering applications on private OpenStack infrastructures for enterprise customers, hosting applications on public clouds, and delivering Software as a Service (SaaS) on private clouds. Drawing from a mix of real-world applications, analyst studies in application adoption trends, and application developer tools and best practices, you will leave this talk with an argument for the strategic importance of deploying your applications on OpenStack, and an understanding of the available tools to start building and porting your applications.
