**Abstract:**

OpenStack is already being deployed almost everywhere, however, not in many enterprises the value that IaaS provides is being obtained. Testing environments, basic big data workloads or niche workloads, such as SSL frontend offloading, are the most widespread uses it is receiving. It is possible to add muscle to your deployment by addressing an important wide number of use cases by deploying OpenShift as a PaaS on top of your OpenStack adding more muscle to it. To achieve better integration among PaaS and IaaS, and at the very same time reach legacy systems and increase control and management a Cloud Management Platform can provide the vitamins needed to enhance the IaaS capabilities, make it stretch beyond its current reach and keep it healthy and under control.

I enjoy being a people's catalyst. My career has grown from User Support and Teacher; through Systems and Network Administration; to Systems Engineering, Systems Architecture and Strategical IT planning. I've always enjoyed working with Development Teams becoming their liaison with Operations and Engineering. That's why, working on the Paas and IaaS arena with OpenShift and OpenStack, is such a thrill. My background has made me specially conscious of the importance of security in all aspects of engineering and architecture.)*
