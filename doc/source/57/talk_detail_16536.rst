Defining the Common Operating Model enables the Cloud Management Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing the cloud requires adoption of a Common Operating Model (COM) that takes into consideration a multitude of factors such as the strategic vision and business priorities set forth by leadership. It also requires both business and technical architecture to translate the strategic vision into new solution capabilities and services in the cloud. Implementing a DevOps approach is fundamental for building cloud-native application workloads but it also breaks down the siloed organization trenches so that delivery is integrated and continuous. The COM promotes a service orientation to deliver operationally with greater agility and scalability, with minimal to no interruption, maximum control, and a strong performance orientation that meets the competitive market head on.
