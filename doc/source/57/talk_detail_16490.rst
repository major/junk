Escaping the Debt Monster: The Case for Creating an OpenStack Community Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the Lead over AT&T’s newly established “OpenStack Community Program” the presenter will explore the strategy for making the case to fund a team of upstream OpenStack Community Contributors and the resulting trials and travails of succeeding! We will cover key principals of the business case, strategy for getting 'buy in', communicating seemingly bizarre new concepts to executives (hint: use trendy buzz words) and the myriad challenges of ‘breaking new ground’. We will NOT cover the typical boring recruit, train, manage stuff. Rather, dotted with amusing anecdotes, we’ll explore the far more fascinating facets of the building phase like Intellectual Property Lawyers wanting to review every commit for ‘patent potential’, a Finance org that funds you with Capital $ (not Expense), never before considering that software which the company never owns, can’t be depreciated, or how to generate a ‘model driven estimate’ for a team that has NO deliverables beyond ‘growing their influence’!
