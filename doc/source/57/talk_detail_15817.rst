Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 1.5, Pets, Cattle: How to tame the menagerie with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises are faced with the challenge of embracing modern cloud native apps to stay competitive and deliver business value faster, while simultaneously having to maintain several traditional IT business critical apps. Keeping aside the discussion of whether we need 2 models of IT (Bimodal), the reality is that enterprises are looking for better automation and improved efficiency to be successful in the market. By supporting both traditional and modern cloud native apps, OpenStack can enable effective automation of both and possibly provide a path for migrating apps from the traditional model to the modern cloud native model. This talk will explore the various challenges that enterprises face today as they adopt the cloud native paradigm, propose how OpenStack can be used to address each of these challenges, provide concrete recommendations with use-cases and examples, and show a demo of how tools built on OpenStack can provide effective automation for traditional and modern apps.
