Enterprise IT in the Land of the Ephemeral Cow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session we’ll examine the organisational aspects of adopting an OpenStack cloud from the perspective of an Enterprise IT organisation. We’ll link the buzzwords of “Cloud”, “Agile”, “DevOps”, and “CI/CD” to concrete business benefits, present a multi-stage pattern for implementing the organisational changes Enterprise IT departments typically need to realise these business benefits, and connect those stages with specific technical tools and techniques.

I specialise in cloud, and in particular OpenStack and AWS, having recruited and lead a technical team of 12 to build the first pharmaceutical industry compliant OpenStack cloud. I have experience architecting and implementing web application infrastructures on AWS, including automation using CloudFormation, Heat, and Puppet. Today I’m a Solution Architect at Mirantis, where my work is mainly focused on helping enterprise IT organisations understand “cloud” and Agile methodologies, and determine where and how these fit into their environments.)*
