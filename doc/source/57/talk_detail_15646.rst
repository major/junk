Multi-Datacenter management based on OpenStack: Coordinating resource scheduling across datacenters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In recent years Internet and mobile services have grown rapidly. This ever-increasing number of users and amount of business require multiple data centers as strong backbone for those services. Enterprises are faced with complexity, high costs, and operational inefficiencies in managing these datacenters collaboratively. To free them from this nightmare, we offer an efficient multi-datacenter management solution powered by OpenStack. Our solution manages heterogeneous cloud datacenters via a “Single Pane of Glass”. It’s able to convert and migrate workloads among datacenters to achieve the global load-balance. We have also enhanced Nova scheduling to optimize run-time resource usage dynamically within each datacenter.
