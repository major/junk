What Copel Telecom and I learned along the way to our first OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Copel is the largest company in Brazil's wealthy Paraná state, and its telecommunications subsidiary, Copel Telecom, delivers a broad range of connectivity and hosted services to its enterprise and increasingly consumer customer base. Cloud was the one key product they were missing from their portfolio. This is the story of how their first cloud came into existence, and what they learnt along the way. Highlights include:    - What do you do when you have an even number of datacenters (but still want HA)    - Coming to terms with the fact that physical hosts (and their VMs) may temporarily (or more permanently) disappear    - What moving from the appliance world to software-defined storage actually implies    - How to handle the fact nobody on your team has any OpenStack experience and more.
