Why OpenStack distributions exist?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many OpenStack success stories out there, and we often hear about how a team inside a company deployed OpenStack and manages it on a daily basis. In the early days, and still to a large extent today, these success stories were always about the team deploying OpenStack on its own. This however hides the fact that a huge number of deployment are nowadays using OpenStack distributions. This session will explore the many reasons why OpenStack distributions exist, and why they should be considered in the enterprise world. Ease of deployment, supportability, certifications, knowledge of the vendor, etc. are just some of the benefits that come with an OpenStack distribution and that should be considered when deciding upon a company strategy around OpenStack.
