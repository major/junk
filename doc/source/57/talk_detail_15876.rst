Don't run your OpenStack as a cottage industry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Often when first setting a Private Cloud organisations are investigating the art of the possible and not necessarily thinking of the service going into full production, but ideally one should expect that investment to pay and soon be a harness carrying essential business services to deliver long term success. Once services do become production ready and bring value to organisations all the traditional concerns of the Operations teams suddenly start to matter, because even if your cloud services are highly dynamic and agile the infrastructure foundation needs to be ROCK solid. See how distribution vendors help you in the search for a platform which won't fear!
