Go below the surface of the Iceberg : IBM Systems strategy with OpenStack update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will discuss the IBM systems support of Open Stack, from what are the IBM systems to how OS is supported.Since many yeasr IBM has been a strong supporter of Open Stack in terms of software investment, but most people may have missed the internal change that happened to have all IBM systems support OpenStack, as controlled nodes (or controllers), providing OpenSTack APIs to any used willing to transform their existing systems to a OpenStack self-service IT without loosing the benefits of their existing investments. We will review how this transformation was made , the recent changes, what systems can be intregrated how, and discuss evolutions coming from client requests. This is right middle of the hybrid cloud solutions: vertical hybrids, horizontal hybrids… and the concepts of using different infrastructures for different tasks: why clients want to do this ?
