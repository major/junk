Fitting OpenStack into your environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When we first test and pilot OpenStack, it often runs in isolation in a separate infrastructure -- i.e., "shadowed" IT. However, as we expand the scope of OpenStack deployment and start to use it in production, it needs to work with your existing operation tools and process and within your existing infrastructure. In this session, we’ll look at how we can fit OpenStack into your IT environment. We’ll also provide management views into both OpenStack and other infrastructure managers, such as vCenter, etc. You’ll also see a demo of how we provide a management view to help manage and automate OpenStack with other infrastructure components.
