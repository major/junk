Practical OpenStack Interoperability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In 2015, The OpenStack Powered trademark program relaunched with new testing guidelines to guarantee a basic level of compatibility and interoperability between clouds with the OpenStack Powered trademark. Over a year into the relaunch, we now have over 40 public clouds, private clouds, and distributions with the new OpenStack Powered mark. This talk will give a practical overview of the interoperability efforts within the OpenStack community, and how to qualify your product for the OpenStack Powered trademark. It will include an overview of the requirements defined by DefCore and the OpenStack Foundation, best practices for testing products using RefStack, and what do to when you run into trouble. You will also learn how to best engage with the DefCore working group, Foundation Staff, and upstream developers in working to certify a product.
