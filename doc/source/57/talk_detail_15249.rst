Push-button Deployment of Oracle Applications and Database with OpenStack Murano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditional enterprise software deployment can be complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.  OpenStack services provide a rich set of capabilities for automated deployment and configuration of raw compute, network, and storage, but have typically left the top of the stack to be managed by traditional configuration management (CM) tooling.  With OpenStack Murano's abstraction capabilities, deployment time can be reduced from weeks and days to hours and minutes, without the requirement to develop and maintain highly customized CM manifests.  Oracle is focused on enabling sophisticated enterprise applications from the OpenStack Murano Application Catalog with pre-configured, pre-tested templates.  In this session, Oracle experts will demonstrate how we have configured and deployed Oracle Database in our test environments using these templates and the Murano Application Catalog and how it can be incorporated into multi-tiered application stacks.
