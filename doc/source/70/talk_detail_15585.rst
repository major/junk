Orchestrate once, deploy everywhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Installing an application once is easy, but what happens if you want to write an application that works on top of AWS, OpenStack and Bare Metal?  In this talk, we'll describe some batteries-included software we've written, deployed, and operated atop multiple public and private clouds using Kubernetes from a single set of installer tooling.  We'll also describe how we made it resilient to failures such that we can remove our bare metal nodes and kill our cloud nodes without requiring operator intervention.
