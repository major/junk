Detecting Black Holes and Micro-bursts with Telemetry Tools for Application Assurance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Service Level Agreements (SLA) for applications are often taken for granted as connectivity and traffic management just works without any glitch. However, when problems arise, tracing packet flows and root causing issues are very complicated in cloud networks by virtue of technologies involved, further complicating application SLA compliance in cloud networks. With multi-tenant networks, ensuring application SLAs is a critical aspect of design as various applications/organizations share the same physical and virtual infrastructure resources. This session will address the following topics: Monitor micro-bursts, traffic flow for application SLA Packet tracing and injection for root cause analysis   Mapping overlay and underlay packet flows Scaling monitoring and analytics for high density data centers
