~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are API microversions Good, or are they Evil? Should they be embraced, or shunned?What in the world should I do about them?Get insight into the API microversion feature in OpenStack from two developerswho implemented them in Cinder and Manila. Scott and Clinton will explain Whatmicroversions are with examples. They will walk through use cases and help toanswer the questions around Why a developer or operator might use them, or even care.They will demonstrate How to use them with clients or directly with the API in orderto access new features or remain with older behavior.
