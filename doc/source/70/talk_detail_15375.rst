Save your money in a different way: A Framework for Dynamic Consolidation of VMs in Openstack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Currently, cloud data centers consume huge amounts of electrical energy, and operators spend much money on energy costs. Does there have a way to relieve this situation? Our team consider that dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) is an efficient approach for improving the utilization of physical resources and reducing energy consumption in cloud data centers. By using decision-making algorithms and VMs live mirgration in Nova project according to their real-time resource demand, this solution will re-allocate those resources and switch idle hosts to the sleep mode. Furthermore, more important resources in OpenStack can be considered too, like Volumes in storage. So we want to share our study and a open source platform in OpenStack that implement the prototype of this idea. Wish this will bring more thinkings and choices to cloud operators.
