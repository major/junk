It’s 2016, Cloud is Advanced and Your Orchestration Engine Needs a PhD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operations and Management has for too long been seen as the harbinger of doom for IT. Much of this is because the greater advances in technology are driving higher demand for IT management capability. These demands have gone beyond a human ability to analyze innumerous elements and swiftly take the appropriate course of action. This lead Accenture to introduce the “Intelligent Orchestration Engine” for OpenStack. Accenture begins by giving the orchestration engine a PhD. in data analytics and performance optimization. The addition of intelligence combined with the workflow requirements has created a holistic and enhanced approach to automation and orchestration. These orchestration workflows algorithmically make decisions that solve inefficiencies before they become incidents or problems. This approach allows Accenture to close gaps found in traditional orchestration and take a homogeneous approach to managing the business, technology, and compliance needs.
