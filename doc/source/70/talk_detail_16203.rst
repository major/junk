Cloud Management Platform lowers the threshold for adopting OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is now penetrating data centers at both corporates and service providers. Making the most efficient use of data center assets is a key strategy for successful enterprises. OpenStack is an attractive new innovative alternative. However, when planning how to deploy OpenStack, one must consider how it can co-exist with other virtualization and cloud technologies already in place. How to accomplish this and avoid unwanted complexity is a challenge.
