All Together Now: Monitoring OpenStack, Security, and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

After deployment and build-out of an OpenStack cloud, operators require a complete end to end single pane view of the SDN-based network overlay, all the associated workloads and hypervisors and physical infrastructure. This view should also encompass new type of resources being widely deployed like containers. Enterprises and cloud providers alike have aggressively adopted SDN visualization and monitoring platforms in addition to OpenStack horizon to keep their infrastructure running with 100% uptime. In this session, attendees will discover: How comprehensive visualization could help operations staff Monitoring and correlation of physical and virtual networks Monitoring and correlation of resources like VMs, containers and bare metal machines Innovative ways of visualizing security groups related informations and interactions between flows and workloads
