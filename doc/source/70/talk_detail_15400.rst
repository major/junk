Scaling Atomic Host with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Leveraging containers at scale presents unique challenges. Using an operating system that is optimized for containers is essential. Red Hat Atomic Host is designed for clustering containers in production. It is fully supported and backed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.In this session we will discuss the fundamental concepts of what containers actually are doing inside the Linux kernel. We will then go through a real-world demonstration that deploys a simple web application multiple times with multiple persistent storage backends in a single Atomic Host cluster. This application platform can will be scaled using Heat auto-scaling.Using this fundamental understanding, reinforced by practical examples, attendees will walk away with a better idea of how to leverage containers in their own infrastructure. In addition to this, all of the demo code is available as an Ansible playbook that attendees can use to replicate and expand the entire demo environment on their own.
