Toolkit Tips to Free DevOps Teams from Dependency Hell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Supporting different OpenStack environments can be difficult. From a DevOps perpective, how do you cope with different versions of the OpenStack client tools? Installing different versions of the client tools on the same host can easily end up in a dependency hell. Having the correct toolbox saves you and your team time and unnecessary work. Even better, having a tailor made set of tool at your dispose will make your work faster and your team more productive. We recognize that this is an issue for many stackers, including us, so we've decided to embrace the issue by building a toolkit that includes the most common pieces and parts used to operate, debug and develop an OpenStack cloud.
