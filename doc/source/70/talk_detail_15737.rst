007 ways to make Ironic's ramdisk your secret agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you deploy bare metal servers with Ironic, there are a lot of tools available to improve the manageability and longevity of your hardware, but you may not be aware of them all. This presentation explains how to use custom agents and hardware managers, even if you're not a Python developer! Have confidence that your data is efficiently cleaned between uses of your servers to prevent leakage from one user to the next. Get metrics that track the age and performance of your servers. Ensure your users won't provision failing hardware. Ship useful logs into your preexisting syslog infrastructure. After attending this presentation you will have the insight needed to get the most out of Ironic with custom hardware managers and agent ramdisk configurations.
