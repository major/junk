A tool to test and tune your OpenStack Cloud? Sharing our 1000 node China Mobile experience.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It is difficult to be confident about your cloud deployment with the many things you need to consider, particular without the ability to measure its performance and stability before making it production. It is even harder to locate annoying bottlenecks, tune the cloud, and confirm whether the optimizations really work. China Mobile kindly allowed us to test, against their 1000 node cluster, our profiling tool that non-intrusively tracks each virtual machine boot request every step of the way. We could dial up and down incoming request rates to identify bottlenecks. With the ability to enumerate every possible state of a request, we were able to troubleshoot the cloud quickly. Combined with monitoring tools, we adjusted the deployment making it 3.3 times faster and 100% stable under 800 concurrent requests per second. Confidence born through experimentation. Quality of Service Assurances backed by data. Come see how we achieved this feat and explore our profiling and analytics tools.
