**Abstract:**

Often OpenStack operators overlook the tools available to them during -- and after -- deployment. As soon as a deployment is done, they often have questions regarding tools to characterize the stack. This presentation summarizes and showcases the entire tool arsenal available to an OpenStack user in every phase of the product deployment. We’ll also summarize and illustrate how these tools improve productivty, functionality and performance during the deployment as well as after deployment. Join us to learn more about OpenStack tools.
