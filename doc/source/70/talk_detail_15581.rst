Kostyor: an upgrade orchestration solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kostyor is designed to automate the process of upgrading a deployment of OpenStack from one major version release to the next major version release. Upgrading an OpenStack installation historically has been very difficult, and not without risk. In order for OpenStack to be used for telecommunications workloads, a number of requirements related to how OpenStack is upgraded, and the impact this has upon tenants and applications has been determined. Reduction or Elimination of Tenant Downtime during an upgrade Visibility into the upgrade process Monitor and collect downtime metrics during the upgrade process In this session, the architecture and features of Kostyor will be presented and we will discuss how Kostyor solves the above requirements.
