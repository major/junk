Lightweight Hardware Management Libraries for Scale-out OpenStack Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will focus on the emerging technologies for scalable server systems management. Lenovo is developing open source based tools and libraries in this area, including the pyghmi hardware management library and confluent management aggregation service. These libraries provide utilities for light-weight infrastructure management, autodiscovery, autoconfiguration, alerting, console management/logging, and other general systems management operations. Additionally, they enable automation via scripting with python, CLI, and REST APIs.  These libraries were developed with particular emphasis on managing scale-out datacenter infrastructure such as HPC, Big Data, and Cloud systems managed via OpenStack.  The talk will also describe strategies to eliminate the overhead of adding/replacing server equipment by utilizing the topology information of the datacenter as the basis of the configuration, replacing all manual per-server actions.
