OpenStack Discovery N Assurance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

I have developed a new and exciting Assurance tool for OpenStack in highly distributed large deployments. a new solution for cloud operations team interfaces to OpenStack API, DB and Command Line tools to gather a lot of data for analysis. it then figures out dependencies and graph the inventory and dependency in easy to navigate UI, monitors objects to provide status, statistics, runs impact analysis, root cause analysis to help OS admin to maintain their environment. I would like to share, educate participants about the major issues it solves and the methods used to tackle the problems. The solution is meant to be open-sourced soon.The tool dramatically simplifies openstack administrator maintenance and troubleshooting processes and lowers the troubleshooting, discovery time (guarantee 90% discovery, troubleshooting time reduction for many use cases). I will share my own field experiences and demonstrate how this technology enhances admin operations around openstack facilities.
