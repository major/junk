Increase Utilization Without Killing Your SLAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack clouds *can* be highly efficient when it comes to resource utilization. In practice, however, fear of violating SLAs leads to gross over­subscription, provisioning far more infrastructure than should be necessary. In fact, utilization rates under 20% are not uncommon. In this session, we’ll look at how new approaches like Soft Container can isolate containers to make better use of idle resources, responding dynamically to increase utilization while safeguarding SLAs. Participants will get an overview of new resource utilization and scheduling techniques, and the session will provide an analysis of how resource interference impacts co-­located applications, and the way to mitigate this.
