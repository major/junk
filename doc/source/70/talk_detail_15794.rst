Billowing Storm Clouds VS. Clear Skies - Autoscaling OpenStack compute nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, youâ€™ll see how a cloud management platform (CMP) can help monitor and manage your OpenStack environment. Use the data that ceilometer is already capturing to determine when your OpenStack cloud needs to be scaled up or down and then use a CMP to automatically orchestrate this activity. This same CMP can also be used to manage and monitor the lifecycle of guest workloads and provide you a single pane of glass to control all of your guest workloads across multiple OpenStack clouds.Using a CMP, such as ManageIQ, you can perform tasks such as:- autoscaling compute nodes to dynamically flex your cloud presence- provisioning instances across multiple cloud providers- orchestrate complex service bundles- integrate with 3rd party systems via REST API
