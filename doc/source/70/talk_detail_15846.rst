~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn how ManageIQ, the open source cloud management solution, can help you inventory, monitor, and manage multiple OpenStack deployed environments from one single user interface. As the foremost private cloud solution for enterprises and service providers, OpenStack needs easy-to-use management capabilities. ManageIQ integrates with OpenStack to automatically discover your OpenStack environment. ManageIQ uses OpenStack’s APIs and components to perform essential operations, such as analysing current capacity of the cloud, alerting when over-utilization of resources is imminent, and providing reports of trending patterns in the OpenStack clouds.
