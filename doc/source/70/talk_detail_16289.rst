Charming OpenStack: Capturing OpenStack operational knowledge in code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session is a developer focus explaining what charms are and how to charm an OpenStack project to have it interrelate with the existing OpenStack charms. OpenStack charms attempt to capture the best practices and operational knowledge into devops code. The focus of the charm is on enabling users who may have little to no knowledge of a particular project to model, configure and deploy that project along side the core OpenStack services.The OpenStack Charms project is a new member of the Big Tent. The session will also cover how to participate in the OpenStack Charms project: how to hack on existing charms and how to get a new charm into the project.
