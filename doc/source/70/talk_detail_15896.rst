Performance Analysis of Workloads run with Browbeat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So you have installed Browbeat - the framework for performance testing, collecting metrics, metadata and results data, now what?  Now you need to analyze your data to find performance bottlenecks, apply tunings, make adjustments and re-run the workloads.  With the Browbeat Framework you can compare all the results data in Kibana and review System Performance Metrics in Grafana for your entire cloud. In this talk we run through Rally and Shaker Workloads and then analyze the results and metrics data.
