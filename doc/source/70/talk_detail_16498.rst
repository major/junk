Debugging OpenStack Networking Reloaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Networking is one of the least understood component of OpenStack and, consequently, one of the toughtest challenges for operators. It is impossible to diagnose most issues with an OpenStack installation without understanding the networking internals, something impractical to do manually. DON, written primarily in Python, and available as a dashboard in OpenStack Horizon, Libery release, is a network analysis and diagnostic system and provides a completely automated service for verifying and diagnosing the networking functionality of a multi-node OpenStack installation. This service verifies (or points out deviations) that the user configuration is indeed reflected in the underlying infrastructure and presents the results in an intuitive graphical display. The results of the analysis are stored in a DB for later retrieval and comparision. Please visit https://github.com/CiscoSystems/don for more recent information.
