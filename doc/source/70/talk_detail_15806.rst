2nd Days of Operations Handled by Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot of requests come from users after stating a cloud. - want to allocate instances booted from same image on separated hypervisors but in same AZ due to performance and HA of their app - want to make a resource reservation for expected future usageThe requests make day2 operations more complicated. When you maintain hypervisors, where will you migrate instances on the hypervisors? When a number of available virtual resources is less than demands, how do you get the available capacity?This talk presents how the complexity of operation resolved by Policy. Congress, Governance as a Service, provides operators with a range of ways to manage and control their cloud by Policy. This will also show you real use case of requests from user and how policies resolving the operation complexity.
