Measuring and Visualizing Cloud Performance with PerfKit Benchmarker and Kibanaâ€‹
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At times, the need for an effective tool to evaluate the data plane performance of cloud environments becomes important. For example, you may want to compare and validate the performance of certain workloads on your cloud after an update. In this talk, we detail how we can leverage three open source tools to easily satisfy this need.1. Google PerfKit Benchmarker: A benchmarking tool geared towards data plane performance measuring. This is in contrast to Rally, a Benchmark-as-a-Service project for OpenStack, which is more for control plane performance at this time. Out-of-the box, PerfKit can run nearly 30 popular micro-benchmarks and workloads, and supports ten different cloud platforms including OpenStack.2. Elasticsearch: A search engine that stores and indexes JSON documents.3. Kibana: An interface plugin that provides visualization capabilities on top of the data indexed by Elasticsearch.Join us to discover how you can use these tools for your performance analysis!
