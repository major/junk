Cisco Litmus: Test the pH of Your Cloud!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you struggled to test your development and production clouds?We did too!!! So we created a service to do it for us!Our Quality Engineering team had a goal of automating and unifyingall of the technologies we use to verify our OpenStack clouds. After much experimentation and some false starts, we developed a framework called Litmus.Litmus configures, schedules and runs the following frameworks:1. Tempest2. Rally3. Selenium for Horizon testing4. An in-house framework we call Sanity. It provides users with a clean, polished web UI to make things easy, but also exposes a REST API that can be used by other services. During our presentation, some of the topics we'll discuss are how we've used Litmus to: - Scale our testing to all of of our clouds with distributed worker instances.- Compare region test results.- Create historical data for all of our sites.- Blacklist incompatible tests by OpenStack release.- Make the pain go away.
