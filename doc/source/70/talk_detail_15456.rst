Cloud Management integration with Ceilometer and Gnocchi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack management can grow more complex and challenging as the cloud grows to scale, and even more so as the cloud moves into the hybrid model. Red Hat Cloud Forms is the leading open source cloud management platform on the market today, providing service catalogs, chargeback, and configuration management.   In this talk we will demonstrate the successful integration of Red Hat Cloud Forms into the Rackspace Private Cloud powered by Red Hat. This talk will demonstrate chargeback through Cloud Forms integration with Ceilometer and Gnocchi, hybrid cloud through integration with multiple public cloud providers, and the development of a robust service catalog.
