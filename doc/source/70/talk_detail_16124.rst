ARIA - Simple, Open Orchestration for OpenStack and Other Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

ARIA is an open, light (serverless), zero-footprint CLI-driven library of orchestration tools that other open projects can consume to easily build TOSCA-based orchestration solutions. With tight integration for OpenStack and conforming to TOSCA interoperability standards, ARIAâ€™s open source and open governance project is a perfect fit for orchestrating application deployments on OpenStack along with other clouds in a hybrid environment.
