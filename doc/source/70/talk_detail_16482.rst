Kolla: Operating OpenStack Clouds in Docker Containers using Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kolla is an OpenStack big tent project that deploys and operates OpenStack cloud environments using Ansible and Docker. In past presentations of Kolla, we have always talked about the technology behind Kolla as the key factor in what makes Kolla fantastic.  Over the last 18 months our IRC channel has built a tight feedback co-development loop with operators participating in the Kolla community.  The best part for operators is we have maintained our technology strengths during this change in our philosophy. With this unintended consequence of operator interaction, we have not only solved the #1 pain point (deployment) and #2 pain point (upgrades) of OpenStack, but are quickly building a tight feedback loop with operators to solve the #3 pain point (operators have unmet requirements).

Steve serves as Kolla PTL for the Newton cycle and served as PTL for the Mitaka, Liberty, Kilo and Juno cycles.  Steve also contributes to the design and implementation of Kolla.  Steve also contributed heavily to the initial architecture, design, and implementation of Magnum, serving as a core reviewer for two cycles. Prior to gaining an interest in container technology, Steve initiated and led the development of OpenStack Heat with a small development team while at Red Hat, Inc.  During this period, Steve served as Heat PTL for Essex, Folsom, and Grizzly. Prior to Steve's involvement in OpenStack, Steve was primarily focused on the development of open source high availability technology leading the design and implementation of Corosync, a group communication system, which combined with Pacemaker is the de-facto standard high availability stack for Linux.  During this period of his career, Steve also served as a technical community leader for the modern Linux high availability stack.)*
