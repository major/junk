Optimizing OpenStack Performance with Genetic Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Optimizing OpenStack for api response time and minimal instance-to-instance latency is a difficult and time-consuming process, but has an enormous long-term impact on user satisfaction. Operators must balance dozens (or hundreds) of values, and many of these values impacting other parts of the system in unexpected and often suprising ways. We explore this "emergent behavior" for further optimizations by applying a genetic algorithm to the configuration superset of an OpenStack deployment.
