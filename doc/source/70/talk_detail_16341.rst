Managing Your Cloud, the CIS Way!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When your cloud's hypervisor list spans multiple pages, it is very easy to get lost in the complexity. If it takes half an hour just to figure out which nodes are running a service, or track down all of the dependent services, then debugging any issue quickly becomes overwhelming.The Cloud Intelligence Service (CIS) acts as the single source of truth for your cloud fleet metadata. This includes metadata of virtual and physical resources , policies, configuration and billing. It aggregates and analyses events from infrastructure services to derive correlation between resources and trigger actions for optimizing the cloud. Built on top of Elasticsearch and integrating ChatOps, CIS provides cloud operators with unparalleled visibility. The capabilities include: History of state changes for cloud metadata objects A searchable web interface & API  Building reports for cost analysis, security, platform optimization etc Join us to see how CIS can light the path through your cloud.
