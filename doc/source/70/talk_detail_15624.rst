One for All: Deploying OpenStack, Ceph or Cloud Foundry with a Unified Deployment Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying production-ready OpenStack is a complex process that asks for a lot of knowledge. Next to OpenStack often other services do exist in a data center which have different constraints. A unified deployment tool significantly reduces the workload for operators and developers.Crowbar is a mature and extensible Open Source provisioning framework wich makes it easy to rapidly, and flexibly deploy OpenStack clouds, Ceph storage setups or other software stacks like Cloud Foundry on OpenStack onto bare metal. It also can utilize different architectures like x86 or SystemZ and platforms like Linux distributions or Microsoft Windows.This session will explain the Crowbar architecture and how to easily build custom plugins to integrate third party application. It will offer an outlook at the future of the project and how to become part of the community and contribute and influence the direction of the project.Crowbar source code and documentation live at https://github.com/crowbar
