Exploiting best of Crowded Automation Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack comes up with a lot of choices when it comes to deployment and orchestration managment e.g. heat, chef, puppet, juju, maas, fuel, dockers, kubernets, ansible, Kolla, Mistral etc. There is a big mess around users about what to use when and which one is suitable for what kind of requirements. In this presentation, I would like to discuss and explain more on usage of these tools, their comparative study and recommendations/best practices for different deployment/automation/orchestration requirements.
