Building Customised Packages for your OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Packages are the key component in operations of an OpenStack cloud. Users can use distro packages built by other companies in their PoC or production system without any changes, however many users want to have customised packages with their own patches. This talk introduces how packages are built for OpenStack projects, and demonstrates how to build customise packages by using StackBuffet: a CI-as-a-Service that automatically builds packages from your source code. StackBuffet has a built-in APT/YUM repository that makes it easy for users to consume these packages. It can also aid testing in different phases from source code testing to final production testing.
