Utilizing an Application-Based Approach for Easier Deployment of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many approaches have been taken to enhance and simplify the deployment process for storage in OpenStack environments. One approach, from partners like Canonical, is to use an application and service modeling tool (Juju) to model, configure, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud, including OpenStack. Come to this session to learn more about the benefits of this approach, the offerings available, and to view a short demo of how Canonical Juju Charms can provide faster time-to-market for EMC ScaleIO customers using Canonical Ubuntu OpenStack!
