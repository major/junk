Islands in the Stream - Consuming OpenStack services for more than just OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, youâ€™ll learn the benefits of running OpenShift Container Platform on top of OpenStack. This allows your OpenShift environment to not only run in OpenStack instances, but also consume other OpenStack resources, such as Cinder volumes and Keystone authentication. Why recreate the wheel with islands of infrastructure? You can keep it all streamlined and available to both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).One of the key benefits of OpenShift is the ability to run legacy apps, which are generally stateful and require persistent storage, in a container. We will show you how OpenShift can dynamically provision Cinder volumes from OpenStack and mount those to containers running in your PaaS. In addition, if you have already spent the time perfecting your Keystone authentication configuration, we will show you how you can leverage that versus having yet another authentication configuration for another platform.
