Cloud Management with Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How do we report on host utilization, point out unused quota, and perform quota management on tons of tenants in a cloud? We will investigate Comcasts strategy for using gopher-cloud and GO to manage and report on tenant utilization, from the beginnings to where we are now. This talk is for anyone who is interested in managing their openstack cloud in a more efficient way by leveraging the GO programming language.
