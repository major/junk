RDO's pipeline with Software Factory and DLRN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The first task of an OpenStack operator is deciding how to install it. If ambitious, you could install from source, although packages might prove more prudent. This talk covers the new way that RDO builds OpenStack packages with a completely open toolchain, and how you can too. This is immensely useful for building your own packages safely, tested by upstream and in-house tests and gates. Red Hat recently underwent a complete shift in how packages are built and delivered using Software Factory. Software Factory is a distribution of software that closesly resembles the development environment of the upstream OpenStack project. This has allowed us to build and test packages and entire repositories continuously. Come to this talk to learn how this software set has allowed us to accelerate our development and deployment pace, and how you can leverage it to bring the same advantages to your own cloud.
