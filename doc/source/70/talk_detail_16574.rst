Ansible + OpenStack: Who, What, Where, Why, and How?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Want to learn how to automate the deployment, management, and consumption of an OpenStack cloud with Ansible? In this talk, Robyn Bergeron, Community Architect for Ansible, will share her knowledge around the various ways - and whys! - OpenStack and Ansible are used together. Numerous projects inside of OpenStack depend upon, or are built solely upon, Ansible, including Bifrost, Kolla, and openstack-ansible, as well as the CI system for OpenStack itself, operated by OpenStack's infrastructure team. Additionally, modules inside of Ansible, maintained by members of the OpenStack community, make it easy to abstract the complexities of OpenStack in an automated fashion. If you're new to Ansible, the session's demonstration of some of Ansible's OpenStack modules will show how easy it can be. And if you're an experienced user? Get to know how some of OpenStack's projects are making advanced usage of Ansible, or find out how you can participate in any of these open source communities.
