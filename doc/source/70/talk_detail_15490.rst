Eliminating Complexity using Model-Driven Design and Deployment of OpenStack and other Big Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack and other big software are extremely complex things that will cause you to spend much time and effort to architect and deploy.   Today, many architects and administrators spend hours upon hours creating written documents based upon business requirements, that quite frankly if wrong, can take weeks or months to re-architect and/or re-deploy.  This session will showcase a method and a solution for eliminating paperwork and reducing the complexity of Big Software through Model-Driven Design. Simply model your architecture, deploy, repeat!

Currently working as the Practice Lead for the Consulting Architect team at Canonical. We help customers focus on their business rather than the technical complexities of software. We do this by providing open source software that allows for model-driven operations of "big software".   )*
