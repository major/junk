3rdparty Openstack CI - testing NFV and SR-IOV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

“If something is not tested is broken” is what you hear when you try to add a new feature to Openstack. Most often you provide tests along with your code to be run by upstream Jenkins. When a custom hardware or non-standard software configuration needs to be tested - it’s the vendor’s adventure from here.   How to deploy, configure and what are the challenges setting up 3rdparty Continuous Integration (CI) for Openstack? What are the tools provided by Openstack Infrastructure Team for this purpose? How to do it in a corporate environment? Two hardware vendors will tell their stories how they did it to test SR-IOV and NFV features in bare metal and VMs.   Keywords: sr-iov (sriov), nfv, zuul, gearman, jenkins, devstack-gate, nodepool, proxy
