Deployment as a Service - Introducing Stack360
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Stack360 is a public web service that deploys private infrastructure in Software Defined Data Center(SDDC). It uses OpenStack Ironic for bare-metal provisioning, and OpenStack Compass for OpenStack or OPNFV clusters.  In this talk, we introduce the main features of Stack360, such as cloud-based deployment of infrastucture from blueprints, configuration versions, and graphical web interface for management, providing Infrascture as Code(IaC) capabilities. We also share our experience in integrating Cobbler, OpenStack Ironic, and Compass by adding remote management capabilities.
