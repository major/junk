ELK Storage Analytics: Logarithmic Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack has become somewhat of a standard as an OpenStack log management service. Elasticsearch, the immensely popular search engine, requires an immense amount of storage, by nature -- but how much is enough storage? How long can you maintain current measures before you need to add more memory? How will changing your log retention as per HIPAA compliance affect your storage capacity? This dilemma can be solved using the growing log information we have available to us along with mathematical analytics. In this talk, we’ll cover how we try to make sense of the data available to us, what deducing methods we use to craft equations for prediction models, and how more research work of this type can allow us to effectively and efficiently tackle problems of similar complexity.
