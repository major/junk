CentOS Opstools SIG and collaboration with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operating an OpenStack cloud infrastructure is a complex task. Running an OpenStack cloud infrastructure turns out to create a complex environment. OpenStack itself does not provide additional tools to handle and to support operators. The CentOS distribution is a stable, predictable and manageable platform derrived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As part of the CentOS project, the Opstools SIG is focused on delivering necessary tools to ease the pain of OpenStack operators.
