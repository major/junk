Validation and benchmarking your OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

After deploying OpenStack successfully, one of your first tasks should be validating and testing the deployment. This session will cover how to use Tempest, an OpenStack integration test suite, to test and validate your OpenStack deployment. We’ll also discuss how to benchmark an OpenStack deployment using Rally. We will also look into benchmarking cloud application templates, and testing scalability and performance.
