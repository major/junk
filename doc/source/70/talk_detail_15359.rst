Skydive - Follow up on your favorite network and protocol analyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SDN solutions are complex and troubleshooting/monitoring them is even harder. Skydive provides a non-intrusive way to visualize the network topology, and analyze and identify the root cause of network issues. We presented Skydive at the last summit in Austin. Since then, a lot has happened in the project, thanks to the feedbacks of the Skydive early adopters :   Tracking of the whole network topology and traffic changes eBPF probes for ultra light traffic capture overhead Improved querying capabilities to integration Skydive in operation tools Deeper introspection of traffic Better container integration with support of Kubernetes and OpenShift Traffic generation This talk will introduce those features and show how they help operators troubleshoot and monitor network environments, and will present what’s coming next.
