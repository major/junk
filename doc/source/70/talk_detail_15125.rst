The Infrastructure Behind the Curtain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As it turns out installing OpenStack isn't really the hard part any more.  Operating and maintaining OpenStack is much harder.  At IBM Blue Box we provide a managed private cloud solution.  This means that we run a large number of single tenant clouds and the infrastructure to operate and support many cloud deployments. We'll cover everything from how we can install OpenStack anywhere in the world with just a laptop (or a USB stick) with some inception level PXE booting, to how we provide secure access for operations to manage servers  ( bastion, ipmi, dashboards ), and how we perform monitoring and logging. Years of OpenStack operational experience and wisdom, distilled down into what you need to know about what really goes on behind the scenes to make cloud work.
