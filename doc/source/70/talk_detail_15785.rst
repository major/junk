MAAS 2.0: hyperscale-grade physical automation for the masses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing phyiscal infrastructure is a pain in the ass. That is, except if you are one of the Big Three, and have a hairy, powerful and entirely homegrown system which can discover, configure and deploy any hardware you might want to purchase. Actually, it turns out that the essential functionality you find in Google, Facebook and Amazon's toolkit is now available to anybody, free of charge. MAAS is an open source tool which is used to automate deployment of bare metal at scale, and which is increasingly seen underneath large and growing OpenStack clouds. MAAS a web UI, but the most powerful way to use it is through its cloud-style API, which lets you ask for physical infrastructure as if it were completely software-defined. As in "give me a server with at least 24 cores and 96GB of memory, configure its two 10GBe NICs into a bond, and deploy Windows on it".
