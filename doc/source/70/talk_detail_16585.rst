Formal method techniques to guarantee consistency of security policy in virtual machine migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Dynamic changes is the key to any cloud infrastructure like OpenStack. Maintaining consistency of information while being dynamic in nature is tricky. Particularly during VM migration the global information like security policy, service level agreement etc. can become inconsistent. In such scenario Formal Method techniques can be used to verify the consistency of such critical information. We propose to show how the formal method techniques can be used to mathematically prove the consistency of crucial information while migrating the VMs across physical hosts.
