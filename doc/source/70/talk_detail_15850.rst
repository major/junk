Oslo Config as a Service (CONFaaS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is an highly customizable based on the deployment scenarios. This is accomplished by enabling each and every component of OpenStack to start with Oslo configuration files. In small deployment, its easy for user to login to the deployment nodes such as controller or compute node and update the configuration files. But this become an cumbersome task when the number of deployment nodes multiplies exponentially for supporting larger cloud base. This could be easier if there is common Horizon dashboard or OpenStack CLI to configure the OpenStack components across multiple deployed nodes. In OpenStack there is no such feature exist today. This problem is addressed by introducing new concept 'Oslo Config as a Service (CONFaaS)' to OpenStack.
