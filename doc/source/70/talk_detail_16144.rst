How to charge your clients?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

After the deployment and the integration of an OpenStack environment it is a common use case to charge the users for provided and consumed resources, regardless of whether it is a public or a private cloud. While there are feasible metering services in OpenStack, billing and rating based on the metering data still is a major nuisance. We will outline the existing metering and billing solution we evaluated for the use at Betacloud and show how we integrated one solution with an online service for quoting and billing.
