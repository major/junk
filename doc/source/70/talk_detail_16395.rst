Network visibility and Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud operations is spending a lot of time doing network related tasks manually which is adding to delays in deploying applications. Some of them include getting subnet(s) and configuring them either on a new or existing rack. It is error prone and time consuming. They are also spending time debugging duplicate IPs and mostly reactive in nature to address new capacity needs. Some of the reasons for this range from manual errors, multiple sources of truth causing maintenance issues, shared network addressing and visibility.This talk will focus on addressing these issues using an external IPAM and building automation around it. The topics covered will include the following which will significantly improve operations and time spent from day(s) to hours or minutes.1. Automate configuration of subnets in neutron2. Avoidance of IP conflicts3. Visibility of current IP usage and plan for future allocation
