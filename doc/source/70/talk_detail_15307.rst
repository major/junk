Failure Analysis Under a Multi-Components Public Cloud Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Our company, NTT Communications, provides the public/hosted private cloud service "Enterprise Cloud 2.0” with OpenStack. For cloud service providers, downtime reduction is essential and thus many operation tools that support failure detection and analysis have been deployed. In our company, we have been using monitoring tools (TeMIP, Zabbix etc.) since the previous cloud service; however it takes a long time to conduct failure analysis across multi-component OpenStack-based cloud service because failure causes are more complex. Our goal is to develop an effective failure analysis tool. To achieve this goal, we added some functions such as "the automatic analysis of states/logs along the service procedure flow", "the cause suggestion based on dependency learning" after analyzing failure cases. These improvements have helped us conduct a failure analysis of service down (instance creation failure etc.) more quickly. In this presentation, we share our development knowledge and use cases.
