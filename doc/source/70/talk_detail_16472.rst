Augmented Reality for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Smartphone-based augmented reality (AR) is now surprisingly easy to create: with mature, cross-platform, open source tools like ARToolkit providing powerful base functions for camera calibration, feature tracking, and dynamic rendering of 3D content over realtime video views. This presentation describes (and demonstrates) how phone-based augmented reality can be exploited to facilitate OpenStack cloud operations: providing heads-up informational displays elucidating the status and interactions of workloads and processes active on physical hardware, and enabling creation and interaction with virtual 3D models on tabletops or other empty 'stages.' The proposed architecture draws from an opensource toolchain rooted in Mirantis Stacklight, which is a sophisticated logging, monitoring, and alerting kit comprising components such as ElasticSearch, InfluxDB, Kibana, and Grafana.
