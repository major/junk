Learn how to use Nagios and StackStorm to automate the recovery of OpenStack services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

I will explain why and how I created an automated deployment of a test environment using Vagrant and Ansible to deploy and configure it. The background behind this is that I needed a reliable test environment for testing new deployments and upgrades as well as running OpenStack demos.  Occassionally I found the demo environment had developed an issue just before I ran a demo so I needed a way to monitor it and ideally get it 'self heal' so it would always be ready to go. A live demo (praying to the demo gods) will show the automatic recovery of services following a simulated failure. All materials will be made availabe after the talk enabling the re-creation of the test environment.
