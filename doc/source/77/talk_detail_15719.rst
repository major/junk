Tapping in NFV cloud : A real world showcase by Swisscom, Ericsson and IXIA.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this tech talk, Sébastien Grognuz from Swisscom, Vinay Yadhav from Ericsson, and Anirban Majumder from Ixia will explain how Swisscom collaborated with Ericsson and Ixia to solve their major challenge of monitoring their new NFV based wireless infrastructure. Swisscom network leverages the Ericsson CEE architecture, which runs on OpenStack, and needed a solid solution to monitor the virtual traffic. The three entities collaborated to implement the opensource Tap as a Service added to Ixia CloudLens virtual visibility solutions, bringing traffic filtering capabilities to allow for more efficient usage of resources when monitoring traffic.


* **Vinay Yadhav** *(Vinay obtained his Masters in Communication Systems from The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) Sweden in 2012. Vinay has been hacking in Openstack since 2011 predominantly in Networking for Layer 3 Services developing cutting edge Research and proof of concepts for VPN Access and inter cloud connectivity. Vinay currently work as an Experienced Researcher in Ericsson Research Unit where he is actively engaged in other projects such as SAIL where he has worked on Federated Cloud Research and distributed service deployments across heterogeneous cloud platforms. Vinay is currently working on developing services around Neutron for better NFV support within Openstack such as adding port mirroring (Tapping) feature in OpenStack Neutron.)*

* **Sébastien Grognuz** *(After several years of experience in wireless core architecture, Sébastien Grognuz switches to the cloud world following the natural evolution of the telco industry. As principal solution architect for the telco cloud program at Swisscom, he leads the deployment of the Ericsson NFV cloud and coordinates the technical aspects among the different projects.)*

* **Anirban Majumder** *(Anirban Majumder is a Software Architect working at IXIA leading cloud monitoring solutions. He has been involved in leading and managing multiple network solution on Openstack and other virtual platforms for more than 4years. Anirban has more than decade long experience leading and working with linux and windows based network, security and monitoring solutions.)*
