Project: OPNFV - Base system functionality testing (Functest) of a vIMS on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) based on OpenStack as the VIM (virtual infrastructure manager) is a growing use case among leading Telcos around the globe. Orange Labs have been leading the “OPNFV - base system functionality testing” project that provides a comprehensive testing methodology, test suites and test cases to test and verify OPNFV Platform functionality that covers the VIM and NFVI components. This project uses a "top-down" approach based on ETSI NFV use-cases and open source VNFs for the functional testing. This session will dive into the functional testing of a vIMS system based on Metaswitch's Clearwater, coupled with the open source tools Cloudify and Jenkins, for the full lifecycle orchestration and management including the monitoring, healing, scaling and software upgrade of such a complex system.


* **Sivan Barzily** *(Sivan is Director of Product for Cloudify at GigaSpaces, working on an open source and open standard cloud orchestration platform that automates and manages complex services throughout their entire lifecycle for telcos and enterprises. Prior to GigaSpaces Sivan was a Product Line Manager at Alcatel Lucent, building an NFV MANO solution. Sivan is an active contributor to the TOSCA standard, and is an expert at the areas of networking, cloud, and service management. Read her posts at the Cloudify blog.)*

* **Morgan Richomme** *(Morgan works as Network architect for innovative services in Orange. He is Orange Network open source evangelist and OPNFV representative. Primarily involved in IMS deployment for Orange affiliates, he managed the project Emerginov (OW2), an open source PHP PaaS that has been deployed in Africa. He has 10 years' experience in managing open source solutions. He is engaged in OPNFV testing group, as Functest Project Leader.)*

* **Valentin Boucher** *(Valentin has been an apprentice Network Architect within Orange Labs since 2014. He is studying at ENSSAT, Lannion. His apprenticeship has primarily focused on NFV; deploying an OPNFV cluster and testing orchestration solutions. Indeed, Valentin has even contributed to the OPNFV standard, through the integration of a fully functional vIMS deployment using continuous integration. Additionally, Valentin is a passionate member of the Fablab group at Lannion and is also working on a LoRa based tracking system.)*
