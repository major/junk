Operations Dashboard: Looking past the Horizon at Telco Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Large telcos like AT&T have begun to realize that a hybrid “shared nothing” architecture for a cloud is the only true way to provide the level of reliability and resiliency we need. Doing this , however, adds challenges around how to provide a single pane of glass view for your entire cloud platform without bogging it down and expending limited datacenter resources. Beyond Horizon, operators at telco scale also have a need to use and view intelligent logging/monitoring/alerting solutions that look beyond OpenStack. Big data provides intelligent frameworks for logging/monitoring/alerting and opportunities to leverage this data to improve the reliability and resiliency of our cloud platform. We will go into some strategies that we think would benefit other operators in their environments.

* **Kayla Fromme** *(I am managing development of OpenStack core components (upstream and internal customizations) at AT&T and deployment of OpenStack using Fuel in enterprise data centers.  My first summit was Vancouver 2015.  I enjoy learning about OpenStack and how other companies are using & deploying OpenStack.  I joined the  Women of OpenStack shortly before the Austin Summit and I am looking forward to becoming more involved. In my spare time I like to snowboard, cheer on the St. Louis Cardinals, and play soccer. )*
