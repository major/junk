NFV Considerations for OpenStack on VMware Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Large set of Telco companies use VMware for running their enterprise workloads today. The next big movement is on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) which would help them to reduce capEx, OpEx and improve agility. The demands of NFV is significantly different from traditional enterprise workloads especially when it comes to reliability and performance. Even though virtualization helps in high degree of automation and resource utilization, NFV still needs to be dependent on physical hardware (passthrough, physical switch configuration etc.) to meet the SLA. OpenStack is being considered as one of the main components in NFV layout primarily for standardized APIs and ability to work with wider ecosystem. This talk will cover details on how OpenStack on VMware provides a path towards addressing carrier grade requirements by better capacity planning, guaranteed resource allocation, improved performance with SR-IOV/direct passthrough, and configurable latency sensitivity options.
