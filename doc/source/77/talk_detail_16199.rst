Benchmarking hardware accelerated OVS with VSPERF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network Functions Virtualization involves using cloud management technology like OpenStack and deploying the network functions on COTS servers (scaling out) to achieve high aggregate throughput. For NFV deployments to work properly, it is very important to ensure that the virtual switching function in the NFVi does not become a data bottleneck, starving VNF applications.  To address this problem, an emerging trend has been to accelerate the virtual switching function in hardware.   For this reason,  precisely understanding the performance characteristics of the virtual switching function, with comparison to accelerated and non-accelerated implementations, is critical.  In addition, the testing of the virtual switching function must be done under conditions that closely approximate the real-world traffic load on the target VNF applications.  This is often difficult with existing test methodologies, but can be improved as we will discuss in this presentation.
