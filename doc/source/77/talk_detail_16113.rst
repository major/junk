Data Intensive Virtual Network Functions on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The successful adoption of NFV depends on the ability of cloud infrastructure to deliver sufficient performance compared to today's proprietary network appliances. Generic hardware isn't equipped, nor configured, to handle this kind of load, and as a result, can't run with the necessary performance large carriers & Telcos require. To achieve such performance, you need advanced processor & networking technologies embedded in silicon and in PCIe devices, but even so, you need to ensure your VNFs are ultimately able to leverage these capabilities. In this talk, we'll show how NFV throughput performance varies depending on proper VNF workload placement configuration, by declaring what the VNF requires from the hardware (SR-IOV, DPDK, etc) and ensuring proper matching & configuration with the OpenStack NFVI. We'll also see how Enhanced Platform Awareness & smart orchestration are enablers for such extreme performance.
