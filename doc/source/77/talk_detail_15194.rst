How to Lower TCO for Network Modernization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the Key Challenges of Service Providers (SP) is Total Cost of Ownership for a new tech site/lab. Especially for PoC/Staging Labs where SP tests & integrates new products/solutions before buying/rolling out in production, they are costly (building, maintaining and operating) and they are mostly under utilized across the calendar year. In order to address temporary site/lab needs via Global Cloud SP offer amazingly low cost compute, storage solutions and they provide secure private channels for Operating, Administrating and Mainatining (OAM) of it. In this presentation we will show how easily be Openstack IaaS to be deployed over AWS and also real time show of cost of resources over AWS Billing System. This approach can be used as reference and improved for low funded Tier3s for network modernization and allows VNF vendors to offer true "pay as much as you use" model by using AWS statistics and Analytics Tools.
