Orchestrating VNF Forwarding Graphs and SFC using OpenDayLight, Neutron and Tacker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Successful deployments of complex Network Services needs dynamic control of traffic flows through VNFs.Even when using SDN, adding new services and changing the related networking in the underlying networks can still be a challenge. Service Function Chaining (SFC) addresses these complexities, making even the most complex scenarios quite simple. SFC implemented in an SDN Controller, like OpenDaylight (ODL), must interact with additional components to automate the entire Service Chaining scenario. A VNF Manager, like Tacker, is necessary to manage the life cycle of VNFs.  Multiple layers need to work in cohesion to make this a reality. This ability to support dynamic VNF Forwarding Graphs using Service Function Chaining differentiates various NFV Orchestration stacks out there in the market. In this talk, you will hear how three opensource projects - Tacker, Neutron and OpenDayLight SDN Controller - coming together to achieve this holy grail of the NFV promise.
