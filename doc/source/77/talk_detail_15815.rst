Deploying network latency sensitive workload for NFV in Helion Operating System (HOS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Virtual bridges are used in OpenStack to offer flexibility to create segmented tenant networks for East-West and North-South traffic. Use of bridges limits the network throughput generated by Virtual Machines, and hence not suitable for NFV workloads. An alternative approach to ensure network throughput for such latency sensitive workloads is to use PCI-SRIOV and PCI techniques.  In this presentation, we will talk about: our experience of enabling PCI on Intel and Mellanox network controllers. how in HPE, we have managed to automate and simplify the deployment of PCI devices to work with OpenStack how easy it is made for a cloud provider to stand-up a cloud supporting deployment of network latency sensitive tenant workloads using PCI-PT and SRIOV techniques. The session will end with a demo of how a tenant VM with PCI-SRIOV/PT would communicate to other normal VMs on the virtual bridge, thus retaining the East-West and North-South traffic untouched, but with greater throughput.
