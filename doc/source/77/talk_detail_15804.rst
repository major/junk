High Availability automation test suite for 5 9’s reliability of VNF workloads in NFV clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV cloud environment requires 99.999% availability and is built at all levels of the ETSI architecture. Testing the HA high availability of the cloud end to end and deriving the 5 9’s availability is always a challenge. We would like to present this automated test suite build on the Rally framework that runs end to end HA scenarios with fault injections on the compute and VM in the NFVI. It also measures the fault detection times and recovery times of the compute and the VM, thereby enabling validating the derivation of 5 9’s availability for the VNF workloadsOur presentation covers the following,Reliability test cases and their work flow.Automation of the test casesDemo of sample test case executionDiscuss the derivation of 5 9’s availability.
