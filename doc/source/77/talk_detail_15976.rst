NFVO / Enterprise CMP convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV has embraced OpenStack as the preferred platform for NFV Infrastructure.  ETSI and other organizations have proposed models for the management layer above the NFVI/VIM while ignoring a lot of the early work done for Cloud Computing in the Enterprise.   We propose that the ETSI MANO functionality above VIM layer closely resembles current Cloud Management Platforms (CMPs) developed for the enterprise.  While Cloud Computing is new, enterprise CMPs have a had a head start on developing frameworks for managing cloud infrastructures.  Enterprise CMPs have already addressed many of the issues related to managing complex applications such as inventory, chargeback, and monitoring.  While the usual justification for embarking on a new development effort for NFV is that NFV has much greater performance requirements for the infrastructure, we propose that adapting current, mature enterprise CMPs to address NFV management requirements is a much faster approach than starting from scratch.

Mr. Vaananen has over 20 years of experience working on mission critical communications systems from companies such as Nokia, Motorola and Stratus. Previously, he held a systems architect role focused on SW & HW communication platforms, along with focus on other products in the broadband IP access and mobile network space. Vaananen is also currently participating in ETSI, OPNFV, OSM and Open-O activities, and has been previously active in efforts in e.g.  SCOPE alliance, IETF (MPLS and QoS), IEEE and  Broadband Forum. He holds over 10 US and international patents.)*

* **Aaron Smith** *( Aaron attended Swarthmore College as an undergrad and received his Masters and Ph.D. From Brown University in Electrical Engineering.  After a brief stay at Lincoln Laboratories, Aaron joined as an early member of a telecom startup and spent the next several years in either involved with system design or asic verification for telco.  After the telecom downturn, Aaron joined another early stage startup in an area now known as the "Internet of Things" helping to build one of the first cloud based HVAC control systems eventually reaching CTO of the company.  Aaron embraced early cloud efforts over the next few years at EMC and Stratus Technologies.  Aaron worked on an early CMP for OpenStack while at Stratus.  Aaron recently joined Red Hat in the NFV Partner Engineering group and has been able to continue working in the MANO and HA space.    "Cloud computing bears a striking resemblance to the work I was doing for my dissertation.  Cloud computing is very similar to massively parallel computing that was a research topic in the 80's and 90's.  It is rare to be able to work on what you studied in school"        )*
