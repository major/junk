Building NFV Cloud for IT & Telco
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With VMs & VNFs needing faster and more reliable throughput in OpenStack environments, high performance technologies like DPDK, NUMA, Hugepages, Real Time Kernel, Transparent VLANs (802.1q via vNIC), and SR-IOV are becoming more and more relevant. IoT & HPC are also presenting themselves as high density workload use cases with a need for low latency throughput. We take you through all the lessons learned in choosing the right open software, hardware layout, and OpenStack features related to performance and stability. We’ll talk through the advantages of DPDK, Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), and Hugepages, some of the lessons learned and the next steps leveraging Mitaka+ for your needs. We will also touch upon Tacker (VNFM & VNFO) and ODL (SDN or NVP) as example case study of expanding upon NFVI out into MANO integration.
