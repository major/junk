The Implementation Synopsis of Gluon Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV brings new networking use cases in the L3 domain, for example, MPLS and L3VPN. Those new use cases need new networking APIs that are increasingly unlike Neutron, and need to be quickly developed and deployed in order to accelerate time-to-market and improve business agility. In addition, NFV requires the flexibility to use multiple networking back-ends in OpenStack, and to use multiple APIs and back-ends simultaneously. Gluon is a Model-Driven, Extensible Framework of NFV Networking Services that enable Telecom Service Providers to provide its customers with new NFV use cases on-demand. Gluon uses a model-driven approach to generate APIs from a YAML file which models the NFV Networking Service. Applications use those APIs to provide the new service. Thus, Gluon helps Telecom Service Providers accelerate the time-to-market and achieve business agility in NFV domain. This presentation gives an overview of the design and implementation of Gluon.
