Modeling Edge Cloud Services using OpenStack "Meghdwar"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenSource efforts to bring Edge Cloud Services have run into archietecural issues as how to serve from Edge while the Smart Phones continue to be registered through Provider portal at the Core or IMS in 3GPP terms. The case in point is Cloudlet efforts through Nova and Advanced Neutron srevices through Service VM. The spekers here will share their experience as how all this will change in new proposed Module "Meghdwar" and how new architecture will help Model Cluster of VM, Application management from Core or Central cloud to serve via edge yet maintain low latency for end users.
