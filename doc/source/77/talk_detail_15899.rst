Service Assurance, a challenge for Network Functions Virtualization(NFV) -- What can OpenStack do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Service Assurance and FCAPS are funtions of Telco operational support systems(OSS). Monotoring fault/performance and autoprovisioning are extremely important for Operationalizing the Network services. While Virtualization and Cloudification of the Network Services is the obvious path forward for Telecommunications, it has presented with the new challenges in handling the Service Assurance aspect. What can OpenStack do? 1. Is Telmetry ready for the task? 2. Is OpenStack keeping up with the ETSI MANO requirements with respect to Service Assurance? 3. How are the various modeling specifications and tools helping with closed loop Service Assurance?  As the Telco Solution Architects at Red Hat working with a major Telecom Operator, we will talk about our first hand experience with the challenges and present some potential solutions.
