Lessons learnt from Customer Deployments using Fuel, Mirantis OpenStack, and OpenContrail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Leading Telecom operators and Enterprise customers have chosen Mirantis OpenStack (MOS) and along with it, an SDN product like OpenContrail, to enable Telco Cloud, Enterprise private cloud, SaaS Cloud use-cases. In such customer environments, it is crucial to have an integrated and seamless deployment of all software components that constitute the cloud software stack. Mirantis OpenStack provisioning is done via Mirantis’ Fuel, an open source tool for deployment and management of OpenStack. Fuel also has a plugin model that allows other components’ deployment to be integrated with Fuel.  In this session we will discuss how the Fuel plugin model was leveraged to provide a seamless and integrated deployment and provisioning of Mirantis OpenStack and OpenContrail Neutron plugin. We will also cover the best practices and lessons learnt in such customer deployments.
