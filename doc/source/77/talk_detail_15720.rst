Meeting SLA: NFV Notification and Remediation using Tacker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The advent of NFV has changed the way TELCOs are beginning to deploy network functions. NFV has brought benefits in terms of deployment agility and cost reduction while also introducing virtualization layers that add complexity and operational challenges. One of the critical requirement for TELCO to maintain SLA is that identifying the abnormal situations of running VNFs and address them to bring it to normal operational state,  automatically or manually. This requires monitoring, async event notifications, remediation such as scaling which has been addressed collectively by OpenStack services tacker, ceilometer, heat, etc. In this session, we will discuss in detail about these features and how OSS can use them automatically to handle the abnormal situations.
