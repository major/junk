Place your VNFs smartly with a smart network monitoring tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Orange is using Openstack in several contexts, from public cloud with Cloudwatt to private cloud distributed all around the world for NFV use cases. Thanks to those experiences, devops teams at Orange agree that better tools to troubleshoot networking are needed. From one deployment to another, we may not use the same SDN controller hence operation team can't rely on dedicated SDN analysers tools. With the emergence of container based VNF, having a unified tool that NFV operations teams can use in mixed environments to monitor, troubleshoot NFV deployments makes a lot of sense. For those purposes, a tool such as Skydive providing live network metrics looks appropriated. This could be helpful to orchestrator tools or even used by the Openstack scheduler to smartly run network constrained applications in geo distributed cloud environments. This kind of feature will soon be needed since ETSI NFV will allow VNF to specify network constraints on virtual links between VNF components.
