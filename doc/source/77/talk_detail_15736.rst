Telco Cloud and Container-Based VNFs Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today most of Telco Cloud VNFs are hypervisor-based and using KVM in OpenStack, the next evolution of VNFs in Telco cloud will be containerization of Telco applications & functions (vMME, vSGW, vPGW, vFW, vLB) and how current Telco Cloud Data Center Design will support those changes. This session will provide an evolution of Telco Cloud Data Center Architecture for containerized VNFs. Current Telco Cloud Data Center Architecture (OpenStack + SDN) VNFs Overlay design principles and use cases Future Telco Cloud Data Center Architecture (OpenStack + Docker +Kubernetes ) Container-based VNFs High availability Container-based VNFs Networking (Overlay/Underlay) requirements Container-based VNFs & Orchestration (Available Options) Container-based VNFs Overlay design with constrainers and use cases End to End Telco Cloud Architecture with Containerization support Â
