A Tour of the Open Source NFV Eco-System: Create, Integrate, Deploy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are a lot of open-source projects which deliver components of the NFV eco-system. The puzzle has many pieces like fd.io, IOvisor, OpenO, OSM, OpenDaylight, CNCF, CNI, Cloudfoundry, etc. – though they all center around OpenStack and OPNFV. This session is putting the different open source projects in perspective and shows how they all organize into a "big picture" – with a special spotlights on OpenStack as the cornerstone project as well as OPNFV as the system-level integration project which equally drives NFV-focused feature evolution and continuous system level composition and testing.
