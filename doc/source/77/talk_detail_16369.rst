Driving NFV High-throughput performance using user space fast data processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Clouds are gearing towards the next generation NFV application which demands high data-rate performace from the cloud. On the otherhand opensource technologies like VPP (Vector Packet Processing) are rapidly growing to cater high performing network application needs. VPP natively runs as a Linux user-space process and creates a vector of packet indices and processes them using a directed graph of nodes resulting in a high performance. If a controller supports OpenStack Neutron (as OpenDaylight does), this provides a easy mechanism for VPP to integrate with Openstack. In this session, join Velmurugan Kumar and Vinay Rao to get an overview on how technologies like VPP can help to deliver high performance resilient networks for Enterprise and Service provider applications. Also the session will go over some scale and performance tools/measurements that can be used to measure the Openstack cloud performance.
