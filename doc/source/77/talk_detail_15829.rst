Root Cause Analysis for NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Fault Management is a critical component of the NFV effort. OpenStack Vitrage, with its RCA  support, brings OpenStack one step closer to giving NFV the tools it needs to become a reality. Fault management in NFV is complex. Problems at physical layers impact the virtual layers, resulting in service disruptions. Due to the high performance required in Telecom systems, fast fault analysis and response is critical in this domain.  NFV Services are comprised of virtual resources that may be distributed across separate (OpenStack) clusters, so failures in one cluster can impact performance in the other. Tracking this impact chain across layers in a production-grade system is challenging. In this talk we present how Vitrage uses its latest Heat data source to give insights into VNF-related faults, and how Vitrage provides a clear and holistic view of the system, from physical infrastructure to the VNF, which can then be used to drive application management policy.
