Containerized workloads challenges with NFV solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers are considered as a potential alternative to Virtual Machine-based implementations. Their popularity among developers incredibly grows with standardization and portability and have led to new microarchitectures providing opportunities to solve large-distributed computing tasks. On the other hand, SDN and NFV are changing the networking landscape providing huge flexibility and functionality to the cloud-based solutions. This presentation will describe cases of using virtual machines for NFV workloads and how containers can address these competitions. This session covers: Cases with NFV and Virtual Machine Implementations NFV with Containers and potential solutions Architecture A hybrid deployment of containers with virtual machines Technical details Attendees will leave this session with a firm picture of existing solutions for using NFV with containerized workloads, their common features, and differences.
