Optimizing, Configuring and Deploying NFV VNF's on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A deep technical discussion on how to best leverage Nova scheduler to configure and deploy applications for NFV.  Virtual Network Functions (VNF’s) typically have critical performance targets and need to predictability get the performance they expect every time they are launched.  The scheduler is a complex beast and knowing how to best leverage its wonderful capabilities to maximize performance will be demonstrated.  We will compare performance with and without leveraging the scheduler parameters that are available and highlight the delta. Providing predictable access to resources for VNFs is a critical part of a successful NFV deployment and we will show you how to accomplish this important goal.
