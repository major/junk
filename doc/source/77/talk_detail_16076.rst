How to help your networking peers roll out NFV solutions and be a hero while at it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You must have heard your colleagues in the carrier/service provider group talk about OpenStack extensively.  If you're attending OpenStack summit you know why, but how could you help your colleagues? What is it that they are looking for?  In this session we will answer these questions and will explain how your existing VMware infrastructure and the expertise could be turned into an OpenStack-compliant Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in which your networking colleagues could deploy their virtual network functions.  By no mean is this a product pitch, but rather a deep dive into the requirements NFV puts on your infrastructure and one experience-based approach to its solution.
