VNF Service Modeling and Chaining on VMware Integrated OpenStack using TOSCA/YANG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the world of NFV, YANG is basically the data modeling language of choice for networking devices, where TOSCA has been selected by ETSI, MEF, Open-O, Open MANO, & many telecom carriers as the de facto modeling language for service orchestration. TOSCA, in the context of NFV, is a language that enables data modeling with a focus on topology and workflows, processes, and policies. Therefore, when you want to manage the full lifecycle of orchestration in an NFV use case, it is important for TOSCA and YANG to communicate seamlessly.  With the powerful integration of TOSCA & YANG it's possible to provision VIM resources, deploy software components & VNFs, wire them in and push configurations, & then chain them to other services. Here we will dive into the different service modeling options for virtual & physical network devices these days, how they communicate, and how to seamlessly deploy them on VMware and OpenStack using a TOSCA/YANG translator and open source MANO solutions
