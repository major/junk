Building a highly scalable fast forwarding application stack using Openstack.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV and virtualized high performance applications, such as video processing, require a “fast data stack” solution that provides both carrier grade forwarding performance, scalability and open extensibility, along with functionality for realizing application policies and controlling a complex network topology. This session discusses how different components in OpenStack and OpenDaylight are being evolved to integrate with the new open source Vector Packet Processor (VPP) forwarder provided by the FD.io Linux Foundation project to build such a solution stack. Being an OPNFV project, FastDataStacks heavily leverages OPNFV’s continuous integration, deployment and test pipeline as well as the automated component install and test infrastructure.
