OpenStack controlled IoT  Gateway to manage a Smart Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Interaction between proprietary Internet of Things Devices along with their data management and security presents a lot of complexity presently. UC Berkeley’s Swarm Lab have come out with a secure, open, distributed data logs called the Global Data Plane, with a communication platform to solve this problem. In this talk we show IoT platform framework or a Universal Software Plane for Smart Homes. Our IoT Gateway platform is based on GDP, which we have containerized and use OpenStack based Flotilla’s framework on the cloud side to establish a dynamic vpn tunnel from the openstack gateway to the Swarm Box and deploy containerized apps on it remotely using a single pane network function portal based on Horizon & Murano. The apps deployed on the swarm box would be having the capability to read/write logs either on the openstack based cloud or on the local distributed data store along with big-data kind of closed loop analytics, making the swarm box a personal cloud for Smart Homes.
