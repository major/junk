Real-Time KVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting near real-time performance for VNF applications requires designing the application with timing requirements in mind and profiling its performance under realistic conditions. OpenStack has developed many functionalities that helps in this, such as CPU and PCI topology awareness and pinning the virtual machines to dedicated cores. The host networking stack, in turn, has been optimized with features, such as accelerated virtual switches and DPDK. One crucial piece of the NFV infrastructure that deserves attention is the performance of the hypervisor layer itself. In the case of the open source, standard kvm hypervisor, the OPNFV project kvm4nfv has been optimizing its latencies to meet carrier-grade requirements. This presentation gives an update of the kvm4nfv project and its recent achievements.
