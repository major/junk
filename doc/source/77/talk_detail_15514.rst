Kazakhstan's First Commercial OpenStack Cloud: KazTransCom's Deployment and Operations Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

KazTransCom  (one of the leading Telecom operators in Kazakhstan & Central Asia) has successfully deployed and operationalized the first commercial OpenStack cloud in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. This has become a cost-effective foundation for a number of important workloads, including e-learning and content filtering systems for schools in the region, cloud services for corporate clients, public WiFi services and various NFV VNF's. KazTransCom continues to add innovations to this OpenStack cloud, such as anti-DDoS solutions and Video Surveillance systems. This session provides detail on: - Benefits to the region from this deployment and workloads running on it - The deployed architecture and best practices on deploying Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Ceph Storage on Cisco UCS - Lessons learned from deployment and operationalization - Agile methodologies to deploy quickly and iterate rapidly instead of a complex cloud rollout - Growth plans, dependencies on OpenStack features.
