Accelerating Enterprise Cloud Adoption with Murano: AT&T Telco Use Cases and Lessons Learned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T is one of the world's largest-scale users of OpenStack, and an aggressive proponent of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) on the OpenStack platform. As they've explored the performance-critical NFV use case and confronted the challenges of building out a viable, 'carrier-scale' business around these technologies AT&T has had to discover new ways of enabling and automating operations for speed and repeatability. One of AT&T's key tools is Murano — which offers a framework for packaging components, apps, and complex stacks, along with configuration details, providing these in an informative catalog for rapid selection, dialog-driven configuration, and automated deployment at scale. It's an example of an advanced tool that serves AT&T's need to describe and package complexity, and to distribute components, apps, VNFs and stacks across organizational boundaries while also simplifying Ops procedures — maintaining control, accelerating ops and working efficiently at telco scales.
