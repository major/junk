Asking the right questions for Storage in NFV deployments, so that you can forget about it !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Architects designing NFV deployments are currently focusing most of their time on providing solid network, compute and automation layers. This is due to the fact, that solving especially network on scale is a challenging task. Nevertheless, most Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) require persistent storage to provide their services.
