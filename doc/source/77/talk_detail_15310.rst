TOSCA & Mistral: Orchestrating end-to-end Telco Grade NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Now you can orchestrate a full NFV service, with TOSCA templates & Mistral workflows on single/multiple geographies! There’s no doubt that workflows are a key ingredient for cloud automation, and automation is a key element in orchestration. However, when looking at an end-to-end, Telco grade, full NFV deployment over multiple distributed sites, orchestration starts becoming trickier. Using TOSCA as the main DSL for the Network Service Descriptor provides a hierarchical view of services, components and their relationships, which is decoupled from the underlying VIM/NFVI. When combining TOSCA interfaces and a mistral workflow, a full network service lifecycle can be achieved. The CloudBand Network Director, an NFV Orchestrater uses TOSCA based Network Service level description and modeling. In this session we will describe and demonstrate using TOSCA templates and a Mistral workflow engine to achieve Telco grade NFV orchestration with the CloudBand Network Director.
