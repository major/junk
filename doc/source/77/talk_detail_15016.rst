AIOrchestra. NFV VIM through TOSCA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AIOrchestra is an engine to process TOSCA DSL to real deployment process. AIOrchestra allows DevOps/Developers to write TOSCA templates to describe how they want to see their apps in clouds and the way how it would get into cloud. AIOrchestra is aimed to be more than just yet another orchestration solution on over-polluted market. This framework designed to be a ground for more complex solutions. So, why AIOrchestra and NFV mentioned in the same context? NFV in the nutshell is just a cloud infrastructure and software, so why do we treat it as totally different beast? Because NFV was a huge new open initiative and it allows to reconsider the way we use clouds and its networking operations on the regular bases. From its initial design AIOrchestra allows developers to build their platforms for further app delivery by using TOSCA and AIOrchestra engine capabilities, in this case NFV VIMs.
