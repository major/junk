OpenStack Adoption in Telcos for NFV: drivers and blocking factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Weâ€™ve been hearing a lot about the use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for delivering virtual network functions in a cloud. In this area, OpenStack has quickly gained a lot of attention from Telco Providers and Application Vendors. The evolution of OpenStack itself is strongly influenced by NFV requirements and use cases, and this is proven by the great amount of Blueprints and initiatives which are NFV-related (e.g. OpNFV). This nevertheless, the adoption of OpenStack in production is quite low, and most Telcos are still in evaluation mode, performing PoCs in their test labs. This session will present to attendees drivers and blocking factors for OpenStack adoption in the Telcos: why is OpenStack so appealing with respect to other platforms? What are the requirements that are driving its development and evolution? What are the blocking factors that are slowing down its adoption in production environments? And what are the community and vendors doing to address them?
