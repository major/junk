Requirements for Building a Virtualized Central Office
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The central office (CO) is ripe for virtualization. And there are many projects, both open source and commercial, that virtualize network functions, eliminating the need to install physical devices for such devices as access or edge routers, optical line termination equipment, and broadband gateways. But what is the role of the controller in a virtualized central office, and what are the necessary orchestration components to make it all work together? This session will discuss everything from the NFV underlay to the SDN controller and the VNF managers/orchestrators needed to build a next generation, virtualized CO.
