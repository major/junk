Running CI on a DIstributed OPNFV Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OPNFV is an open source community focusing on accelerating the evolution of NFV products and services through creating an integrated platform which includes components like OpenStack, OpenDaylight, KVM, etc. In order to build a system that fulfills the requirements of VNFs, it also collaborates with the underlying upstream projects to fill any gaps. In addition to addressing the telecom needs, our activities cover an E2E flow of integrating, deploying, validating and verifying the platform. This provides many challenges as we deal with a diverse and complex project. This presentation provides an inside view of the challenges we were facing from the early days to the latest release as well as goals for the future. You will be part of our journey as we will show how the different deployment tools, test frameworks and lab infrastructures distributed across 3 continents work as collective whole. Particularly outlining how we managed to establish OPNFV CI within this diverse environment.
