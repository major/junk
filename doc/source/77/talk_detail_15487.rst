NFV Service Assurance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the overwhelming adoption of Openstack, tools such as Ceilometer can be leveraged to build a service assurance platform that performs autonomous event correlation from different network sources. Ceilometer, along with other open source monitoring tools, can provide an NFV Service Assurance Platform. This platform receives data from tools such as nagios for hardware, sflow for network information, ceilometer for VM and VNF's performance & fault through VNFManager/Orchestrator and  many more.  Service assurance in NFV can truly help to extend services such as self-optimization and self-healing within networks where Correlation engines correlate collected data and perform root-cause analysis, service impact analysis and inter-op with policy management and VNFs. Assurance helps user to predict any stoppage in service and perform the corrective action. The actions may include evacuation, live migration, scale out/in based on the policy defined by the network service.
