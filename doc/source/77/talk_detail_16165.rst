Infrastructure and service modeling strategies to deploy NFV in production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation will review the findings of operators, tool and platform vendors, and telecom system integrators to when dealing with the challenges of obtaining meaningful and actionable information when designing and deploying modern carrier-grade services in real world scenarios.  NFV and OpenStack provides vendors and network operators with transformational capabilities for service innovation and architectural flexibility. However, this flexibility introduces significant complexity in VNF service modeling, performance testing, verification and ongoing maintenance.   The presenttion will explore how network operators can successfully manage OpenStack-based NFVI and VNF selection and onboarding. Including how automation frameworks together with comprehensive and integrated verification procedures are being used to accelerate service delivery, verify interoperability, performance, reliability and security.
