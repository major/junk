End to End Network Service Deployment in Tacker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Tacker is a generic VNF Manager and NFV Orchestrator that performs Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) life cycle management and configuration. In this talk, we will present the Network Service Descriptors (NSDs) support within Tacker that enables dynamic composition of network services, allowing users to orchestrate a collection of VNFs and forwarding graphs.     NSD templates mainly describe network elements as a relationship between different network element and their links to be instantiated in the NFV infrastructure.  An NFV Orchestrator can use NSD to instantiate a network service which may have one or more VNFs,  Virtual Links (VLs) and VNF Forwarding Graphs (VNFFGs). In this talk we will discuss:     * Aspect of NSD in NFV MANO     * NSDs walkthrough     * Network Service Fault Management and case study     * NSD workflow in Tacker     * How to leverage NSD templates for VNFFG
