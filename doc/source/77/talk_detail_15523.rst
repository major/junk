Juju modeling of DPDK based NFVi in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Juju is a universal service modeling system that models services and their relationships. This service-orientation makes Juju particularly well suited to support the deployment of OpenStack NFVi services, enabling high performance DPDK based interconnection between the VMs. Using Juju, 6WIND has developed some Charms to quickly and easily deploy some NFVi DPDK packages and some applications that provide that fastest interconnection with a full-service and full-SDN support of Neutron’s networking models.
