OPNFV SFC with OpenStack and OpenDaylight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data centers today are becoming more and more complicated to manage. Adding new services and changing the related networking usually requires involving system and networking admins and can take weeks to complete. Software Defined Networking (SDN) promises to improve this situation, and Service Function Chaining (SFC) will make it even easier. We will show how integrating OpenDaylight (ODL) SFC with OpenStack and a VNF Manager, all in an OPNFV deployed environment, can greatly increase the manageability of data center networks. We will show how the VNF Manager creates Service Function VNF VMs on-demand, based on the needs of different Service Chaining configurations. Once multiple service chains have been created with their respective VNFs, we will show end-to-end traffic through the different service chains, and show how the tenant traffic behavior transparently changes depending on the service chain being used. Demos will be Vagrant-based VMs, enabling participants to dig in at home.

He has been involved in SDN’s development since it emerged from Stanford, including early OpenFlow and OpenStack work. During ODL’s Helium release cycle he bootstrapped ODL’s performance efforts. In Lithium, he focused on building ODL’s upstream delivery pipeline, including RPMs, Vagrant base boxes, containers, an Ansible role and a Puppet module.
