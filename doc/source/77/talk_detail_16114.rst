On the Journey to Cloud Native VNFs on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Explore a platform that can bring VNF development closer to becoming fully cloud native.   Network functions have advanced significantly from their original dedicated hardware. Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides the underpinnings of much of the recent work around Network Function Virtualization. While there are containerized VNFs, running in a container does not necessarily mean it is cloud native. In general, VNFs are not cloud native yet.   In the Use Case section, several questions will be considered to determine whether your service may or may not be cloud native. While some VNFs have challenging requirements and are difficult, the majority can be made cloud native.   We will review what it means to be cloud native and explore a platform that can help bring VNF development closer to being truly cloud native on an OpenStack cloud.
