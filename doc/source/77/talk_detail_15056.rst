NFV use case. Software-defined vRouter with AIOrchestra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AIOrchestra is an engine to process TOSCA DSL to real deployment process. By use of modern python 3.5 technologies like coroutines with async/await syntax AIOrchestra allows DevOps/Developers to write TOSCA templates to describe how they want to see their apps in clouds and the way how it would get into cloud. AIOrchestra is aimed to be more than just yet another orchestration solution on over-polluted market. This framework designed to be a base ground for more complex solutions.   In NFV, the most widely spread use case is - virtual router. So, it does really matter how you get router into OpenStack, would it be Neutron plugin or would it be a NFV on top of OpenStack. The most flexible way to get vRouter into OpenStack is to use TOSCA as modelling language and AIOrchestra as tool to convert TOSCA into executable graph.
