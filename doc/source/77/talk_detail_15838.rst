VITAL: A framework for Benchmarking and Characterization of Telco grade Virtual Network Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As we observe a proliferation of Virtual Network Function offerings from various vendors, benchmarking and performance characterization of these VNFs on an Openstack environment is of utmost importance. In our talk, we present a framework that has been designed and implemented at HPE, which uses a two pronged approach to the problem. In the first approach, we address the issue of determining an optimal output set achievable, for given a set of input virtualization knobs such as the sizing, VIF model, pinning etc.,. The output set is a list that can span across parameters such as throughput, latency, jitter or other VNF/solution specific attributes. The second approach of the framework is to start with a least-common-denominator input set of virtualization parameters and try to achieve an optimal output set by automatically varying the inputs. The framework also implements monitoring vital characteristics such as CPU/Memory/Disk/Network I/O and correlates this with the input sets.
