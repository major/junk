Out of the Box Resiliency for Network Function Virtualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many virtual network functions available today are software representations of hardware and can consume large quantities of dedicated resources, which often sit idle, to meet capacity requirements. By developing a framework that shifts the burden of providing resiliency away from the NFV vendor towards the operator, we believe many of the obstacles impeding the ability to create cloud solutions which meet capacity needs and optimize resources can be removed. AT&T has devised a framework for NFV that provides resiliency features as services that can be leveraged by the NFV vendors. This allows vendors to focus on function versus cloud resiliency and helps eliminate legacy dependencies from the NFV as resiliency breakpoints. Another aim is to help encourage vendor participation by facilitating resiliency that can be customized to an operator’s specification. Vendors can then avoid having to create vendor specific resiliency implementations for each target operator.
