SuperHEATed Orchestration: doing more with HEAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Use the powerful heat engine to do more than just application life cycle management. https://github.com/ckravi/super-heat Taking a real life production example of Telco NFV cloud delivering vCPE solution, we show that apart from  application lifecycle mangement and orchestration, there are other needs like  admission control, service class/SLA aware oversubscription, intelligent placement, VNF license management etc. Currently these aspects are built as management applications on top of heat.In this example we show how to create custom heat resources that can be used to efficiently solve business aspects of cloud application life cycle including priority based oversubscription, admission control, licensing etcEnabling this via the heat engine allows:- Uniform declarative business policies- Version controlled business policiesIn short, superHEATing for fun and profit.

We embedded active decision making entities into CIMOM which helped move functionality of custom-built management applications into the middleware.  )*
