OPNFV: Architectural Planning & Deployment Deep Dive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OPNFV Community has created architectural requirements defining an base NFV Platform deployment. In this session attendees will be introduced to the architecture established by the OPNFV community and the architectural prerequisites needed to deploy an NFV Platform according to OPNFV standards. Once a base architecture is discussed attendees will be introduced to the OPNFV Apex installer and walk through the required configuration files necessary to successfully execute a deployment using the Apex installer.
