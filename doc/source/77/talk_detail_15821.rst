Streamlining VNF Management: Requirements for a Generic VNFM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  The NFV promise is a “standard” and “commoditized” VNF deployment environment phasing out proprietary hardware network appliances, which are configured and managed by vendor-specific EMSs. Management of the virtual infrastructure is being simplified by VIMs, i.e. OpenStack, but as vendors virtualize their VNFs and make them cloud ready, existing EMSs are augmented to provide the VNFM function.  While this coupling might allow vendors to utilize their knowledge of the application to enhance the VNFM capability it also continues the outdated practice of application-specific VNFMs. Generic VNFM would streamline the overall solution.   This talk presents work underway at Verizon to develop Generic VNFM requirements, which depend on the VIM capabilities, type and complexity of the VNFs, and a robust set of VNFDs. An analysis of the possible pros and cons of open source approach with projects such as Tacker, OpenBaton, Juju vs. vendor specific approaches, i.e. Nokia’s CBAM is also presented
