Automation Testing: Leveraging the right open framework for VNF Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Yardstick is an open-source tool to verify compliance of the VNF environment. The use cases are taken into consideration from ETSI GS NFV 001 which suites the need for the highly complex environments. The use cases is considered in Yardstick in form of test cases. Yardstick needs access to the Openstack to create and ssh to VMs, connection to external network of the environment. The project's scope is to develop a test framework, test cases. The VNF Workload Characterisation Framework supports the automated testing of VNF platform configurations and the capture of associated data in an OpenStack Cloud Environment. The framework provides orchestration of the full test lifecycle including deployment of the VNF, starting/stopping packet generation, collection of test data, creation experiment metadata and termination of the test case Â
