Adapting the Openstack experience for cloud newcomers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OVH now manages one of the largest Openstack-based Public Cloud. Sounds great and simple, but the reality is that we had to address dozens of personas and thousand of specific use cases! You want to push OpenStack to an heterogeneous public whether cloud ready or not? Discover the feedback we had from thousands of customers all over the world, after introducing then to OpenStack. We will also share with you choices and modifications we introduced to build an "Openstack Cloud for everyone".
