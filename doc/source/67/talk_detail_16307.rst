"Does IT Matter?" redux: pricing as a strategic differentiator for cloud domination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As any Summit attendee knows, much discussion through today has focused on implementation minutiae, the cloud equivalent of "speeds and feeds." With OpenStack reaching maturity, and "basic" features more or less widely available, the competitive focus will shift to business differentiators: positioning, tactical sales execution, and pricing <- our topic today. Drawing on my experience licensing the original OpenOffice.org, as well as teaching behavioral economics, I will discuss pricing models we see in use today, as well as pricing shifts we can expect to develop over the next 6-24 months. As an independent networking vendor, Midokura partners across hardware, software and services, and I draw from partners to present case studies where pricing proved to be the decisive competitive weapon. Last but not least, I discuss practical applications of behavioral economics to cloud software pricing, and suggest "predictably irrational" techniques useful for both vendors and operators.
