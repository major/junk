Hybrid Private Cloud - The Only way to Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For too long, the purist’s answer to the question of how to run legacy workloads in the cloud has been “don’t bother, they aren’t a fit.” This answer is neither helpful nor correct. There is a valid way to run legacy workloads, hybridized across legacy and cloud infrastructure, as your team works toward the eventual full refactoring of the application (or sunsetting as appropriate). In this talk, we will offer an approach to legacy and mixed workloads, which may not be a full fit in and of themselves, but are still mission critical to your enterprise. We discuss how to run these workloads in a hybridized private cloud, what approaches make the best sense, what are the key things to plan for, what a logical application architecture looks like, and how you gradually transition from legacy workloads to cloud-native workloads in a controlled, low-risk way.
