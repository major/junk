Are you scared of isolation? Think about Alliance.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

If having workload “flying” between cloud vendors to reach a business outcome is interesting to you, then you need to know all about Alliance. Alliance is a Software Defined Gateway that enables multi-vendor cloud seamless integration under a single pane of glass. Probably to get to the conference you took one or more flights and you must have notice (if now we are telling you) that many carriers are sharing that flight. So think as you (the passenger) as a workload, you have to go from A to B and a carrier may not have too many passengers on that route, but it will use an Alliance to retain the customer and give him/her the necessary business outcome. Why cloud workloads should be treated differently? Why Cloud Providers that are strong and competitive in a region should not win your business? Well using Alliance all this would be possible.
