A Workload-Centric View of OpenStack Cloud Economics moderated by Owen Rogers, 451 Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Industry analysts like 451 Research are enabling buyers to have transparency over complex pricing models of public clouds, including TCO. As more and more CIOs are considering hybrid cloud and key question becomes what measurements can CIOs rely on to make apples to apples comparisons between public, hybrid and on-premise private solutions? In this session, each of the panelists will bring their POV on pricing models based on their experience operating public and/or private OpenStack clouds. Panelists include Juniper, a provider of OpenStack Distro and networking; GoDaddy, an operator of public and private clouds based on OpenStack; Midokura, a provider of software network virtualization and OpenStack operator; 6Fusion, a provider of vendor-agnostic Workload Allocation Cube (WAC) for cloud cost optimization. They will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various OpenStack consumption models (Managed, Distro, DIY) and cost models in the context of the application workloads.

Billing OpenStack with Ceilometer  - How Bits get to Coins.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In recent times, more and more companies migrate their infrastructure stack onto OpenStack. But when it comes to the challenge of building a cloud and billing its users, they fail due to missing appropriate solutions. The available ones are often lacking of necessary features, are inflexible and even cost intensive. Additionally the solutions often need intensive and complex configuration to be even able to collect data relevant for billing purposes. A question arising through those challenges is:Can OpenStack be billed by itself?During his talk Christian Brinker answers this with a clear ‘Yes’. He points out, how only based on Ceilometer the relevant data can be collected and processed. Backed up by his experiences from public and private Cloud projects, he presents common mistakes in the configuration of Ceilometer and shows ways to automatically derive invoices from Ceilometers raw data. Thereby topics like scalability or the connection to third-party systems are discussed as well.

Bite off More Than You Can Chew, Then Chew It: OpenStack Consumption Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While deciding on your OpenStack deployment methodology is important, sometimes the biggest issues arise from customizations that weren't well planned. We'll talk about thinking through when and where to use nonstandard configurations and the operational and business impacts of doing so.  Equally important to your success is the model by which you consume OpenStack.  The topics we will cover include: Consumption Models, Pros and Cons Stability vs. Capability Maintainability vs. Customization Building an OpenStack Practice vs. Consuming OpenStack as a Service Costs, Operational Challenges, and Upstream Considerations associated with each consumption model Approaches to Managed OpenStack After leaving this session, you'll be prepared to think through the long term ramifications of your deployment and customization decisions on your organization as a whole, and make better decisions as you continue your OpenStack cloud Journey

Snapdeal's Journey from Public to Hybrid Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

India's largest e-commerce marketplace, Snapdeal is migrating to a Hybrid cloud built on Openstack. India's growth story has been unprecedented lately fueled by the proliferation of smartphones. Snapdeal is at the center of this digital revolution being the largest e-commerce marketplace in the country. Snapdeal was born in the cloud, but public clouds stops being cost efficient after an inflection point. Last year we decided to build our own private cloud and in a short 10 months period we have successfully built our Hybrid cloud using 100% opensource, with Openstack being at the heart. Our cloud is spanned across 2 Datacenter regions, has highly dense compute architecture with 70000 cores, 10 PB of storage and a 100G SDN infrastructure. We are running on community release of Openstack Kilo customized for our needs. I'll share some of the choices that we have made & the key learnings during this phenomenal journey, followed by a quick demo of our hybrid capabilities.

In for a Penny, In for a Pound: Private OpenStack vs Public Cloud”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The economic benefits of public cloud are touted by many as the reason to look at a migration away from internal datacenters, but what if this wasn’t actually fact?  Deploying an OpenStack based solution inside the datacenter can be as cost effective if not more effective than the large public cloud vendors.  The Open Software-Defined everything movement has allowed for storage, compute and networking to drop to pricepoints that have only been seen my the largest cloudscale vendors.  This session evaluates both the capital expenditures as well as the operating expenditures of traditional datacenter deployments, modern open source and software defined deployments and the public cloud, providing a virtual blueprint of where an enterprise could save costs and increase efficiencies by using each solution in the proper way.

Are you scared of isolation? Think about Alliance.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

If having workload “flying” between cloud vendors to reach a business outcome is interesting to you, then you need to know all about Alliance. Alliance is a Software Defined Gateway that enables multi-vendor cloud seamless integration under a single pane of glass. Probably to get to the conference you took one or more flights and you must have notice (if now we are telling you) that many carriers are sharing that flight. So think as you (the passenger) as a workload, you have to go from A to B and a carrier may not have too many passengers on that route, but it will use an Alliance to retain the customer and give him/her the necessary business outcome. Why cloud workloads should be treated differently? Why Cloud Providers that are strong and competitive in a region should not win your business? Well using Alliance all this would be possible.

The irrelevancy of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is irrelevant. Or it should be, by all means. And that is a good thing. A sign of maturity and evolution of the cloud platform that, unless you are in the boring business of delivering infrastructure, should always be considered as the means to an (service/application driven) end. In this session we will talk about what needs to be achieved before that final status of irrelevancy. The underlying cloud needs to be, in no particular order: Economic Resilient Reliable Scalable Flexible We will provide the audience with tips on architecture, design, cost models to get to an irrelevant openstack cloud as the first step to a successfull service rollout and operation.

The service includes a unique combination of long pursued features within the industry: SLA driven, optional cloud control transfer and reasonable commitment period. We manage your cloud as if it was our own, literally. After pitching OpenStack to several hundreds of companies, I do believe this unique combination constitutes the easiest way to enjoy the benefits of OpenStack without shifting a large quantity of resources from other, probably more relevant, tasks. I have been selling, talking and living OpenStack since its creation in 2010. That very same year, I co-founded an OpenStack native company that made the first OpenStack Distribution available worldwide.

Consuming IT: How to shift from fixed IT cost allocation to an on-demand model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The legacy Enterprise IT model is constraining. As the world moves to agile IT consumption, enterprises are limited in how they can adapt their IT cost allocation to a flexbile, on-demand model. Why allocate 12 months of IT costs to a project when AWS charges for services consumed by the hour? This presentation will show how Enterprises can evolve from their fixed IT cost allocation models to a more dynamic, on-demand cost allocation model, turbo-charging their agile IT initiatives. A case study of how an Enterprise made this successful shift will be presented in detail.

Hybrid Private Cloud - The Only way to Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For too long, the purist’s answer to the question of how to run legacy workloads in the cloud has been “don’t bother, they aren’t a fit.” This answer is neither helpful nor correct. There is a valid way to run legacy workloads, hybridized across legacy and cloud infrastructure, as your team works toward the eventual full refactoring of the application (or sunsetting as appropriate). In this talk, we will offer an approach to legacy and mixed workloads, which may not be a full fit in and of themselves, but are still mission critical to your enterprise. We discuss how to run these workloads in a hybridized private cloud, what approaches make the best sense, what are the key things to plan for, what a logical application architecture looks like, and how you gradually transition from legacy workloads to cloud-native workloads in a controlled, low-risk way.

Do OpenStack Private Clouds Provide Cost Savings Over Public Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session is for OpenStack operators that want to hear about on-premise OpenStack total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) from their peers. A panel of OpenStack customers will discuss public cloud vs. OpenStack private cloud TCO. Let’s face it, everybody talks about benefits such as Agile IT etc. but when it comes down to it, cost often becomes the most important consideration. With a public cloud, you get a monthly bill telling you exactly how much it cost. However, private cloud costs are not always obvious or easy to measure. So how should operators compare these two different implementations? This user panel will discuss topics such as: do you really save money with a private cloud? If so, why and how much? What are some obvious considerations? What are some non-intuitive or non-obvious considerations? Additionally the panel will talk about best practices that can lead to solid TCO savings and mistakes that could destroy any TCO savings.

"Does IT Matter?" redux: pricing as a strategic differentiator for cloud domination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As any Summit attendee knows, much discussion through today has focused on implementation minutiae, the cloud equivalent of "speeds and feeds." With OpenStack reaching maturity, and "basic" features more or less widely available, the competitive focus will shift to business differentiators: positioning, tactical sales execution, and pricing <- our topic today. Drawing on my experience licensing the original OpenOffice.org, as well as teaching behavioral economics, I will discuss pricing models we see in use today, as well as pricing shifts we can expect to develop over the next 6-24 months. As an independent networking vendor, Midokura partners across hardware, software and services, and I draw from partners to present case studies where pricing proved to be the decisive competitive weapon. Last but not least, I discuss practical applications of behavioral economics to cloud software pricing, and suggest "predictably irrational" techniques useful for both vendors and operators.

Double Win! Helping to consolidate OpenStack implementations (and build a Startup in the meantime)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we plan to expose our really great fun trip from being part of a DevOps team to founding an OpenStack startup in 1 year, using Open Source software to develop a product to leverage OpenStack operation to IT departments, helping users to understand what's going on while operating, thus helping build OpenStack Talent. We often hear "Too much time trying to debug things”, "The cost of acquiring OpenStack talent is high", "If you think that you can run a cloud by leveraging existing IT Ops, think again." - These phrases were our inspiration to try to develop a solution that could answer and help to consolidate OpenStack implementations. On the technical side, our solution is 100% Python based (backend), and gets information from OpenStack APIs, Linux processes, logs, etc. to notify on events and get the information displayed in a beautiful dashboard. It's very extensible, so the agent can be enhanced in features just by developing a plugin.

OpenStack Consumption Models and Distribution Mechanisms (Distro is just one way!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While most consumers assume OpenStack Distribution is the only way to consume OpenStack, there are Five different ways one could consume OpenStack [1].- Distributions (commercial or not)- Appliances- Professional Service Providers- Hosted Private Cloud Service Providers- Public Cloud Service Providers Similarly, OpenStack is delivered through multiple ways, such as Distributions, Appliances or As-A-Service. In Austin Summit, the panel on Consumption Models [2] covered pros and cons of each consumption model. This talk builds on that panel session, by walking through each consumption model and distribution mechanism, along with best suited workloads for each model. Finally, this talk will provide basic TCO comparison of these models.
