~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While most consumers assume OpenStack Distribution is the only way to consume OpenStack, there are Five different ways one could consume OpenStack [1].- Distributions (commercial or not)- Appliances- Professional Service Providers- Hosted Private Cloud Service Providers- Public Cloud Service Providers Similarly, OpenStack is delivered through multiple ways, such as Distributions, Appliances or As-A-Service. In Austin Summit, the panel on Consumption Models [2] covered pros and cons of each consumption model. This talk builds on that panel session, by walking through each consumption model and distribution mechanism, along with best suited workloads for each model. Finally, this talk will provide basic TCO comparison of these models.
