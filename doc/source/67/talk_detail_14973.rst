In this cross-public-cloud provider presentation Bruno & Bruno will walk you though the business case behind an OpenStack public cloud and show you how the numbers stack up in comparison to Amazon AWS discounted prices for reserved instances. From Cloud to BareMetal, from IO to Compute intensive, the will demonstrate the performance/price ratio of OpenStack, so you can make an informed decision on when it is best to use it.
