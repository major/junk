Double Win! Helping to consolidate OpenStack implementations (and build a Startup in the meantime)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we plan to expose our really great fun trip from being part of a DevOps team to founding an OpenStack startup in 1 year, using Open Source software to develop a product to leverage OpenStack operation to IT departments, helping users to understand what's going on while operating, thus helping build OpenStack Talent. We often hear "Too much time trying to debug things‚Äù, "The cost of acquiring OpenStack talent is high", "If you think that you can run a cloud by leveraging existing IT Ops, think again." - These phrases were our inspiration to try to develop a solution that could answer and help to consolidate OpenStack implementations. On the technical side, our solution is 100% Python based (backend), and gets information from OpenStack APIs, Linux processes, logs, etc. to notify on events and get the information displayed in a beautiful dashboard. It's very extensible, so the agent can be enhanced in features just by developing a plugin.
