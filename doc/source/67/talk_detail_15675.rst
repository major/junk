The irrelevancy of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is irrelevant. Or it should be, by all means. And that is a good thing. A sign of maturity and evolution of the cloud platform that, unless you are in the boring business of delivering infrastructure, should always be considered as the means to an (service/application driven) end. In this session we will talk about what needs to be achieved before that final status of irrelevancy. The underlying cloud needs to be, in no particular order: Economic Resilient Reliable Scalable Flexible We will provide the audience with tips on architecture, design, cost models to get to an irrelevant openstack cloud as the first step to a successfull service rollout and operation.

The service includes a unique combination of long pursued features within the industry: SLA driven, optional cloud control transfer and reasonable commitment period. We manage your cloud as if it was our own, literally. After pitching OpenStack to several hundreds of companies, I do believe this unique combination constitutes the easiest way to enjoy the benefits of OpenStack without shifting a large quantity of resources from other, probably more relevant, tasks. I have been selling, talking and living OpenStack since its creation in 2010. That very same year, I co-founded an OpenStack native company that made the first OpenStack Distribution available worldwide. I am also a regular speaker in OpenStack, Hosting or Cloud events worldwide. Prior to OpenStack...there is nothing)*
