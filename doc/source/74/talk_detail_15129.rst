Lessons learnt from running the Linaro Developer Cloud on AArch64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Linaro is providing developers with access to a cloud-based native ARM development environment, which can be used to design, develop, port and test server, cloud and IoT applications without substantial upfront hardware investment. The Developer Cloud is based on OpenStack Liberty, leveraging both Debian and CentOS, as the underlying cloud OS infrastructure. It will use ARM based server platforms from Linaro members AMD, Cavium, Huawei and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., and will expand with demand, and as new server platforms come to market. These platforms will include both single socket and dual socket configurations as well as 10/40Gb networking, scalable storage and integrated accelerators that ARM SOC partners are bringing to market. This talk is about how we deployed the Linaro Developer Cloud and how we opened it to developers. We will also explain what the operation of it looks like and talk about the main issues we've encountered.

OpenStack and Software Defined Infrastructure has been the main target of my work for the past few years. As the SDI Tech Lead at Linaro I am working closely with many different upstream projects and stakeholders to ensure a good user experience of OpenStack on AArch64. )*

* **Andy Doan** *(I've been working on embedded Linux plaforms since 2006 on everything from bootloaders to managing production aarch64 services. I'm currently the lead of a systems engineering team that's managing a pure 64-bit ARM deployment of OpenStack.)*
