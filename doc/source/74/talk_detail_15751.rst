From Baremetal to Production OpenStack Cloud in Hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You’ve heard countless times that the path to adopting OpenStack in your company will be long and complicated. Well the Operations team at the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) has focused significant effort on improving the OpenStack deployment process. We’ve built a repository of code and documents which make it possible for anyone with a minimal level of proficiency to end up with a living OpenStack environment on any number of baremetal servers. These documents have been continuously improved during our weekly test cycles where novices (system admins who are new to OpenStack) start with a rack of baremetal nodes and end up with a fully functioning OpenStack installation.  Come find out how you can use what we’ve learned to get a production OpenStack cloud up and running in hours!
