Operating OpenStack and Docker on a Budget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As you can imagine, life gets busy for a tiny OpenStack team of 2 responsible for 1K+ virtual machines, and growing, and thousands of containers in a multi data-center cloud, while the recommended best practice for admin to VM ratio is closer to 1 to 250. Setting up global monitoring and administration for two multiple centers can be a challenge and a balancing act to meet the requirements for rapid prototyping in Dev/Test environments, as well as the needs for stability required for running traditional workloads like telephony and back-office apps. This session will discuss the transition from a public to a private cloud and how it enables us to do so much more by using the KISS principle, with the same resources yet without over-simplifying our setup. Here we share our best practices and our mistakes that we learned ever since deploying OpenStack Grizzly, all the way to Mitaka. Get a taste of the alphabet soup plunging headlong into the project.
