Performance Tuning for Openstack Specific Hypervisor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hypervisors suitable to Openstack are the key to run a cloud, the reality is Openstack performance is not stable as expected due to lack of experience on hypervisor. We will at first summarize Openstack performance issues and bottleneck, introduce resource isolation and density technologies as solutions for tuning Openstack specific KVM based hypervisor, and share best practices about Openstack hypervisor performance tuning. The agenda is as below:1. Performance issues and bottleneck on Openstack2. How to tune a generic KVM hypervisor to an Openstack specific hypervisor for high performance3. Hypervisor tuning introduction on Isolation and density of CPU, network, memory and IO4. Hypervisor workload monitoring and benchmark5. Openstack performance tuning statistics analysis and comparison among various flavors of hypervisor6. Openstack Hypervisor operation experience including update/upgrade/migration7. Best practices on Openstack hypervisor performance tuning
