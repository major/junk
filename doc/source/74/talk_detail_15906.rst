~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk shows lessons based on the case of upgrade OpenStack Icehouse to Liberty in large scale deployment by RDO.   NTT Resonant Inc., one of NTT group company, is an operator of the "goo" Japanese web portal and a leading provider of Internet services. We have been operating OpenStack as our service infrastructure since October 2014 in production with 400 compute nodes to provide more than 90 web services.   We upgraded our OpenStack from Icehouse to Liberty directly on June in 2016. Some lessons were learned from that, also good and bad know-hows were discovered during the test and the performance. We’d like to share our experience with those who concerned about the upgrading.
