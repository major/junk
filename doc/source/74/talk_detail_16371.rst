Estimating Resiliency: Is your cloud carrier-grade?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Your cloud runs mission critical applications. You’ve designed your applications to be resilient – but they depend on your cloud for resiliency. Is your cloud resilient? Will it fail when you need it the most? This is one of the primary challenges facing organizations seeking to deploy Openstack based private clouds today. In this presentation we will present a formal method for analyzing infrastructure software running a cloud platform. We cover various areas from high availability, failover, upgrades, configuration failures & auditing, upgrades, etc. The focus will be on analyzing software faults, identifying the impacts of those faults, verifying the findings and using specific prescriptive methods to mitigate and/or fix problems identified.
