Chasing 1000 nodes scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Performance working group is working on identifying best OpenStack performance verification since Mitaka, and this session is about one of our researches done during Newton release cycle. This research is targeting on how  evaluating OpenStack workability and performance at large scale. In particular, we will discuss in this presentation 1000 nodes cloud emulation testing on top of two different testbeds. Scripts that have been used to perform those tests are freely available so that anyone can evaluate the performance of an OpenStack deployment either on different hardware as well as software parameters.
