Migrating legacy workload to openstack lively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At present, openstack has been widely used, but before that many companies have had their own traditional virtualization solution running for long periods. Now these companies want to apply openstack, and at the same time they want previous virtualization solutions to be integrated to and managed by openstack platform, Existing integration solutionÂ  is to export original virtual machine as a openstack image, and then import image into openstack platform. There are two problems in this solution, the first is low performance caused by multiple image conversion and image copy, the second is interrupted VM services. we provide our solution to solve them.
