Test OpenStack on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This topic will talk about the possiblity of run OpenStack on OpenStack. In this way, you can try and test the OpenStack over OpenStack in most case. No more need baremetal at all. I will share the best practis to implment this. All of this is implemented by the Kolla project, which deploying the OpenStack in container.
