Large Scale OpenStack Cloud Management Using Puppet and Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many people manage OpenStack clusters with Puppet-OpenStack, and some one with Ansible. Everyone knows, Puppet is good at defining the final state of services, whereas Ansible is good at task scheduling. For OpenStack cluster deployment and management, we just need to combine the advantages of both. How? We use Puppet-OpenStack to manage cluster, and ansible to schedule Puppet-OpenStack. So that we cloud rapidly deploy cluster and converges it to the final state. In Qihoo 360, we already use this way to manage a plurality of large OpenStack clusters, and it really makes our lives easier.
