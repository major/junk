Running an OpenStack Public Cloud with a small team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we will talk about how ScaleUp launched a Public Cloud Service based on OpenStack. Initally a commercial stack was used but had license restrictions and lacked scalability and innovation. Since an object based storage service was needed, OpenStack Swift was deployed. The Swift installation was later merged into a new installation for Nova, which replaced the commercial cloud stack. We will talk about how we operate this "Vanilla" OpenStack cloud with a small team. Also, we will share our experience on upgrading the initlal Swift installation from Icehouse to Juno and also about our experiences (and problems) upgrading the full-stack (Nova, Neutron, Swift, ...) from Juno to Kilo and Kilo to Liberty.
