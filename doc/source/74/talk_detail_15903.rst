**Abstract:**

Openstack deployment procedure typically involves many tasks. Mistral's model assures a perfect fit for easy management of different tasks within an Openstack deployment workflow. In Mistral , Openstack deployment workflow can be further divided into set of tasks.These tasks can run independently or in parallel.Openstack deployment workflow can further be paused/resumed as required and the tasks can be re-run independently in case of any unseen problems.  Mistral provides a convenient way to manage and debug the tasks, as each of these tasks have their own state and error information.
