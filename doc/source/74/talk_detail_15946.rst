Automate Physical Switch port configuration for hypervisors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session is on automatic configuration of VLAN for the hypervisor connected switch ports on the TOR switch. Currently Cloud/Network administrator needs to configure VLANs manually for each physical switch port that belongs to hypervisor, as number of hypervisors increases, there is a need to automate the VLAN configuration programmatically so that manual intervention can be avoided. Usually hypervisor connected ports are trunk ports. We can also specify trunk port configuration using the baremetal network provisioning CLI. This project is available in Github.https://github.com/hp-networking/baremetal-network-provisioning

Previously had worked in software defined network application Hpconverged control which is l2gateway discover and management project which provides communication for NSX hosted VXLAN booted Virtual machines attached to Logical switches with vlan configured unmanaged Baremetals. This projects brings an idea of extending ironic provisioned baremetals in VLAN network communicate with VXLAN booted virtual machines hosted on openstack compute nodes. Aspire to expertise my career in Openstack and bring in lot more inventions to provide best solutions to customers and own the success.)*
