Down the RabbitMQ hole. Succeeding with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Unfortunately, Rabbitmq has a negative connotation in the OpenStack world. We think this is without merit. This presentation will give you some important tips to prevent, rather than cure, problems with OpenStack due to RabbitMQ. We will cover things like OS settings, installation, high availability, tuning and monitoring, security and encryption, performing upgrades, troubleshooting, and more importantly key things we have learned about RabbitMQ running in large deployments.
