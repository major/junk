Growing pains - network, storage, and control plane woes. Lessons learned.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While Openstack has matured significantly over the years there are still scaling challenges with "out of the box" configurations. This talk will highlight some of the challenges encountered, solutions reviewed, and lessons learned. We'll take a look at Neutron, Rabbit, Cinder and other services that have failed to perform at scale. We'll also look at solutions; some simple some not so simple. Ultimately the user should walk away with a better idea of what to expect from certain services in large configurations.
