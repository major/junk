Utilizing an Infrastructure-Based Approach for Easier Deployment of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many approaches have been taken to enhance and simplify the deployment process for storage in OpenStack environments. One approach, from partners like Mirantis, is to focus on the Infrastructure layer using the Fuel framework, which provides a single UI to deploy OpenStack as well as third party infrastructure components. Come to this session to learn more about the benefits of this approach and to view a short demo of how Mirantis Fuel Plugins can provide faster time-to-market for EMC ScaleIO customers using Mirantis OpenStack!
