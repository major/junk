Getting the Most Out of Rally for Improving Scaling Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Rally project gives OpenStack developers and operators relevant and repeatable benchmarking data to determine how their clouds operate at scale. In this session, learn how to use Rally to deploy your cloud, runs specified scenarios, and retrieve/analyze the results of those tests. In this session, you will learn how to install Rally, then configure and connect it to your OpenStack instance. We’ll then discuss best practices to design and run benchmark scenarios, and how to generate benchmark data reports. If you need to know how your OpenStack cloud will handle scaling, this session is for you. Scaling is hard, but Rally can help. Attend this session to unlock a wealth of community wisdom on how to make sure your OpenStack cloud is up to the challenges of scaling.
