Managing Mistral Workflows with CloudFlow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

CloudFlow is a brand new graphical toolkit for managing Mistral workflows in the most convenient way possible. The Mistral workflow service has been around for 3 years, gaining a solid community of users who apply Mistral for a large variety of use cases. Since the beginning however, it's been challenging to work with complex parallel workflows that consist of tens or even hundreds of tasks, just by using command line interface or RESTful API. Not easy to trace errors, see the entire workflow structure or make changes. Something has always been missing... But what?  Presenting CloudFlow! With CloudFlow it’s now easy to build workflows in a drag-n-drop style. CloudFlow provides the ability to view graphical representations of workflows, run & debug them, trace errors and do a bunch of cool stuff. In this session, we'll introduce the shiny new member of the OpenStack community, code-named CloudFlow, and show a demo of how managing Mistral workflows just became a walk in the park…
