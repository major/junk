From Our Code To Your Production Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For an OpenStack developer, it's sometimes challenging to understand how a feature will be integrated in production. And sometimes cloud users might wonder how a feature has been developed, integrated, and automated in a production cloud deployment. In this talk, we'll laugh about the famous "it worked on devstack". We'll also show you step-by-step how we develop a feature in OpenStack and then integrate it in TripleO, which is a project aimed at installing, upgrading, and operating OpenStack clouds. Come and see how your production cloud is developed and deployed under the hood.
