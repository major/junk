Policy in Business Reality for OpenStack Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Keystone provides the mechanism for RBAC thoughout the OpenStack deployment. The access right depends on the policy at the entry of API. This presentation will walk though the policy custom in business reality. To start, we'll give a basic tutorial about policy with upstream keystone and share the real case we encountered and the way we solved in reality. This will be an interactive session and attendees will be encouraged to ask questions, make comments and share their experiences with the policy they custom in real business.
