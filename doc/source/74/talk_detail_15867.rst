Deployment Silver Bullets: OpenStack Dockerization Pros and Cons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Installing and configuring OpenStack never was a simple endeavour. Is it now? Modern deployment tools often add complexity to the process and introduce even more "consultingware". Docker proliferation makes new promises in complete product lifecycle management and projects like OpenStack Kolla gain more and more popularity. Is Docker a new Silver Bullet that solves installation and configuration issues? What are new solutions and at the same time new constraints?

Finally landed at Oracle to do amazing things in OpenStack project, dockerizing and orchestrating the latter, leading QA testing of Oracle OpenStack for Oracle Linux releases.)*

I have been involved with OpenStack in one way or another since the Cactus release, originally working on Glance in a public cloud environment. Currently I am part of a team in Oracle that produce OpenStack for Oracle Linux based on the Kolla project, of which I am also part of the core team.)*
