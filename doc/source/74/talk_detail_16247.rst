Datacenter Deployments of OpenStack from ToR Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With current networking technologies, many top of rack switches are not being used for their full potential. Most are installed, plugged in to their uplinks and various servers and storage, and forgotten about. What if you could deploy OpenStack to an entire rack of servers that the switch is connected to? What if you could deploy the rack next to it from a single switch? What if you were able to deploy an entire Datacenter from a top of Rack Switch for a scalable OpenStack deployment? With Ubuntu, Juju, and MAAS, this is possible to do from a top of rack switch. This presentation will go over the configuration of installing Ubuntu, MAAS, and Juju on a top of rack switch, and then, using that switch, deploying OpenStack on to a rack of servers, and even having it provision another top of rack switch to show that this process can be managed for future buildout across an entire data center.
