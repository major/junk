Openstack & Enterprise Hypervisor - A Nightmare for service providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Installing Openstack on a greenfield seems much easier and boosts confidence over using an enterprise hypervisor like vmware/hyper-v.Since Openstack is evolving very quick and changes get in more frequently the challenges keeps piling up. There are lots of challenges in terms of selecting the right set of packages and Integrating enterprise supported version packages.We miss out on many feaures as the stable release of enterprise gets in late in market. We are trying to find a way how we can stabilize this situation and get a stable installation and working solution everytime we deploy openstack.
