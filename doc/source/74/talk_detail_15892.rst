Volkswagen Car Configurator: Running Cloud-Friendly Applications on OpenStack in the Real World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When was the last time you saw a true cloud-native application in the wild? How about in the wilderness that is a large enterprise? Enterprises are adopting cloud technologies in the context of larger operational and organizational transformations. As they undergo these changes their architects and developers must find ways to conform to IT constraints and leverage the data assets extant in their environments during the transition. Enterprise IT cannot adopt wholesale cloud native architectures because applications must use the enormous amounts of critical data that only exists in legacy systems. In this talk we’ll use the example of Volkswagen’s Car Configurator to explore how Volkswagen has leveraged OpenStack to bridge the legacy world into the cloud, utilizing data services, continuous delivery, software defined load-balancing, and other techniques to enable agile response to business needs.
