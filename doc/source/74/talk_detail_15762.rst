Keep it simple: End to End Visibility for troubleshooting OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

DevOps has led to the accelerated adoption of OpenStack-based private cloud regardless of the industry vertical. As developers excel at building, testing, updating, deploying, and running, and maintaining the applications, operators are proactively looking at removing roadblocks underneath. To succeed, Operators should have end to end latency visibility for Instances supporting the several application parts in all the stages s to remove bottlenecks in the host, network or storage. Such speed and agility will accelerate DevOps adoption in the environment. In this session, we'll share actual use cases, how end to end latency visibility have helped OpenStack private cloud operators drastically reduce response time without taxing hardware, WAN or reconfiguring environment settings for each phase and has lessened the burden on them.
