Transforming Enterprise IT using OpenStack with Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is not only for cloud native workload. Recently OpenStack has been releasing fantastic capabilities for supporting traditional workload such as VM live migration and Shared File Storage. However, enterprise user is not satisfied only by these features. To operate mission critical workload on OpenStack, we need to develop more functions to keep NFR. e.g. HA cluster support / backup & restore / monitoring. And the client hopes to deploy these features with minimal labor hour. So we need to develop automation solution with OpenStack.This session will provide architecture and operation patterns for hosting traditional enterprise applications into IBM BlueBox Dedicated on SoftLayer with fully automation.This session is based on a real transformation case. LIXIL is the most comprehensive and connected global company in the housing and building industry, delivering human-centric innovation that enhances people's living spaces. GROHE and AMERICAN STANDARD are subsidiary companies.
