OpenStack and ManageIQ: Installation, configuration, and usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Installing ManageIQ for OpenStack is easy. But how do we utilize ManageIQ over OpenStack effectively? In this session, we will install ManageIQ on OpenStack and then look at using ManageIQ from three different perspectives: operators, infrastructure administrators, and end users. From the operator's perspective, we will show how to create service catalogs; user, project, quota, and roles management; and chargebacks based on metrics from OpenStack Ceilometer and service catalogs. We will also demonstrate a typical user's workflow, including lifecycling of resources, scaling resources up and down based on the application's requirement, using service catalogs, and viewing resource and application usage and billing. From the perspective of an infrastructure administrator, weâ€™ll show how to do capacity planning, right sizing, and monitoring and managing resources. You will also learn to query infrastructure capabilities and view system-wide applications usage, chargeback reports, etc.
