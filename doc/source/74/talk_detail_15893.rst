Full OpenStack Lifecycle Management with Fuel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing an OpenStack cloud has always been complex. Even simple configuration changes on a set of nodes do not come cheap when you have to keep HA OpenStack installation up. Some teams do it with CM tools, some add home-brewed orchestration on top. This often turns into a unique suite of tightly integrated tools that becomes hard to maintain for DevOps teams. That’s what we let our users avoid with project Fuel - we provide end-to-end pipeline from the user-friendly deployment instructions to low-level state enforcement executed by a smart data driven orchestrator. New Fuel Mitaka capabilities allow for better, faster and smoother execution of complex operator-defined workflows, along with integration with external services and data sources (CMDB, LDAP, IPAM, etc.). We will show how to use these features both for day-to-day operations (change service config, install extra packages, add an OpenStack service) as well as for trickier ones (cloud upgrade, control plane recomposition).
