Non-distruptive OpenStack upgrade while skipping a release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the growing adoption of OpenStack in production environments, upgrading deployments is going to be a more relevant topic for operators.We have previously shared our experience with upgrading an Openstack Cloud while skipping a release. While we still follow the same upgrade strategy,  our customers demanded zero downtime of the OpenStack workloads along with skipping a release. This lead to restructuring the upgrade process and formulating a better workflow while making it non-disruptive. This talk gives a technical overview on how we achieved a non disruptive upgrade in an OpenStack Cloud. It will walk through the complete workflow of the process along with the pre-requisites and other requirements. We provide useful hints both for OpenStack operators and future upstream development.

I started using Linux when I was 15 years old and joined SUSE as an apperentice in 2012.)*
