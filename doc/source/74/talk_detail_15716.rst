~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing multiple regions in OpenStack is one of the most difficult tasks for OpenStack administrators. Now we have ways to manage multiple OpenStack regions -- and get consolidated reports. Join us to learn how we use a Cloud Management Platform to do this. You’ll also see how a Cloud Management Platform allows us to get into hybrid environments, create services, and much more.
