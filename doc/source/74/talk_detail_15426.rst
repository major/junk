QoS QoS Baby
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Quality of Service (QoS) is typically associated with networking, however it can be applied to all components that make up the cloud infrastructure (i.e. compute, network and storage).  In fact, unless a cloud-wide approach to QoS is taken, enabling QoS features may not have much of an effect on performance. This session will explore the QoS features that are currently available or upcoming in OpenStack, with an eye toward coordinating QoS across the entire cloud infrastructure in order to ensure that the cloud will meet the demands of critical applications.
