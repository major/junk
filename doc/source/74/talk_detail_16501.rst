Addressing Open Issues in Container Orchestration using OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Frameworks such as mesos, kubernetes and docker swarm make it possible to run containerized applications at scale across a fleet of container host. However, there are several open issues that are yet to be addressed around operationalizing these frameworks in productions. Issues such as managing the lifecycle of the underlying infrastructure (onboarding, decommissioning, maintenance, autoscaling etc), health check and monitoring, identity management, certificate / key management, security & access control, integration with existing systems (IPAM etc) and more.In this session we will list out the open challenges around operationalizing the container frameworks and propose ways in which OpenStack can be used as the platform to address these gaps, making it easy for enterprises to take these container frameworks to production.
