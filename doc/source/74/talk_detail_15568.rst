Designate - The "Why" and the "How"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, Graham Hayes and Kiall Mac Innes will show the a few of the different options for deploying Designate, and how it can fit into different uses cases, including Public Cloud, and different types of public cloud setups. Graham and Kiall have both ran Designate as a public cloud service, and have produced productised versions of Designate for use in private clouds. We will highlight the benifits for end users, using tools like Heat, python bindings, Shade and Ansible and others, and how this also benifits Cloud Operators in both private and public clouds.
