A New Approach to Scheduling Database Management Tasks in Trove with Mistral
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the features that has long been on the Trove roadmap was support for scheduled backups. One of the challenges with implementing this is the need for a scheduler and something to control scheduled execution. Re-inventing these components in Trove was something that no one in the community wanted to do. This session will discuss how a Trove-Mistral integration can meet these requirements as well as needs far beyond scheduling backups, features such as auto-scaling clusters or master database auto-failover. In this talk we will share how users can use Mistral to provide Trove-centric views to schedules and events. This approach provides example workflows for such functions as periodic database maintenance or reconfiguring replication sets when a site fails (i.e., failover).
