Let’s Make Live Migrations Great Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Live migrations are critical to the life cycle management of OpenStack clouds and workloads running on them. The general problem is getting a predictable process that minimizes failure, the overloading of hosts, and workload downtime. Several features were introduced in Mitaka and Newton, wuch as live migration force complete, and post copy. In previous releases, there were few techniques available to ensure that the migration process finishes successfully, so all of these features are important for cloud admins to understand.   In this session, we will share our benchmark results, including different scenarios aimed to determine patterns of workload activity that affect performance of live migration as well as the reasons for those effects.
