Two years of running a SaaS on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running a SaaS is not easy. It presents endless challenges. We have faced them over 2 years of developing, deploying and running our own multitenant SaaS for realtime data processing. We have learned a lot and we want to share some of the challenges we faced and how we solved them. This includes managin 100s of users, storing TBs of data, building our own custom deployer and creating a custom CI/CD pipeline.
