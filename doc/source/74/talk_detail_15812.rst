The Infrastructure As Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Handling infrastructure as code is the vision that led to OpenStack and what we want to carry all the way through. The session has for goal to explain how TripleO is to be used to deliver your infrastructure as code.  We will describe our end vision for the project, demonstrate how it can and is already be applied today. What are the next steps and why it’s crucial for our users to start consuming OpenStack using these principles.
