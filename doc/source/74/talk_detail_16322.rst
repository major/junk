How to be an OpenStack Operator and still sleep
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack clouds scale larger and larger, a knowledge (and expectation) gap is opening between people tasked with architecting and implementing the cloud, and those whose job is to operate it day to day. In such situations, innocent actions may produce unintended consequences. Ops engineers and teams may experience sleepless nights (and stressful days) as a result — forced to do forensics on unfamiliar cloud architecture and configurations, while under heavy pressure from the business to keep end users happy, and comply with SLAs. This session aims to close the knowledge gap and head off stress by sharing best practices and lessons learned in the trenches of OpenStack production ops. We'll discuss some of the technical flora and fauna you may encounter, propose methods for informing yourself about OpenStack clouds you didn't engineer, and discuss oft-overlooked configuration and service tunings that can improve stability, and help you get a good night's sleep.
