OpenStack and Magnum: Kubernetes as a Service for everyone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kubernetes is one the major orchestration solutions for Linux containers. It's makes easy to have distributed, self-healing and autoscaling containers clusters.  However operators can have a hard time setting up a Kubernetes cluster. Quite some efforts have to be put in place even for the creation of a simple cluster. Things get even more challenging when security, flexibility and scalability have to be taken into account. And what about making everything automated to satisfy the requests of all the tenants?  Now all developers and operators can run away from this complexity by using the Kubernetes offerings inside of the OpenStack clouds. This talk will show how OpenStack can act as the perfect platform to run Kuberenetes clusters by using the Magnum project. OpenStack Magnum component simplifies the required integration with Kubernetes, and allows for cloud users who can already launch OpenStack resources to also create application containers to run their applications.
