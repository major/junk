Health-Monitoring of Large-scale Multi-site OpenStack Clusters based on Tempest and Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With rapid development and maturation of Openstack community, more corporations are running their core businesses on OpenStack. Operation engineers usually need to manage lots of clusters, some of which have a large scale and are heteroideous. Openstack has a lot of components, which leads to complex deployment and configurations. And the basic service monitoring cannot be able to reflect the status of a cluster comprehensively. In this situation, Qihoo360 uses Tempest to do integration testing for each cluster. We use docker and kubernetes to construct several isolated environments to host tempest. The solution is used in our dozens of clusters, which is proven to be effective.
