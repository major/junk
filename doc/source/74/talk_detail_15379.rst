Deploy cloud service with Heat and Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this topic, we will show you how to leverage Ansible and Heat to bootstrap clustered applications in Openstack cloud platform. The OpenStack cloud platform is built on a variety of separate interlocking services - including separate services for storage, networking, identity, and more. We use Heat to orchestrate the resources of clustered applications. And configuring application is an complex task. We’ve got frontend and backend services, databases, monitoring, networks, and storage for an application. Each has their own role to play with their own configuration and deployment. We use Ansible tool to ensure all these tasks happen in the proper order. After all, we have the performance report for the newly configured application cluster according to presumed workload for user informantion.
