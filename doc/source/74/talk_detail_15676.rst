Let's run Openstack Bare Metal cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running bare metal cloud on Openstack is not trivial nowadays. We're not only far from full feature parity with VMs but also need to handle more use cases specific to bare metals. In this talk we would like to present our approach to the problem of deploying bare metal cloud. We mixed Ironic Discovery with RadosGW and K8s to establish status of nodes and interconnections between them. We will walk you through the whole lifecycle - getting nodes into the datacenter, HW discovery and finally handing nodes over to customers.
