Public Cloud Agility with Your OpenStack Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprise IT organizations have an important strategic goal:  Ensure their private clouds are as agile as public cloud deployments without compromising, security, scale, or performance.  Faced with the demands of application development teams, which require rapid provisioning of infrastructure for test, development and production; IT organizations are wrestling with the above conflicting mandates.  One of the key drivers for the OpenStack platform is to provide an alternative to proprietary ‘lock in’ found in other cloud platforms.  Critical to broad adoption of the OpenStack platform will be HEAT, Murano, and the ability to orchestrate and automate full stack application deployments.
