Troubleshooting Openstack with Pacemaker High Availability Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Troubleshooting Openstack issues related to, or possibly caused by Pacemaker High Availability Cluster : Learn how to differentiate between a resource issue (resources being components of Openstack) and a Pacemaker cluster issue (issues resulting directly from the Pacemaker daemon stack, either configuration of the cluster, stability of the underlying servers, and normal cluster behavior impacting your environment. Addtionally, we'll cover some basic troubleshooting techniques available in Pacemaker cluster, and general statuses of resources to help you understand what each status means to pacemaker, what steps can be taken in pacemaker to recover from a failure, and how to achieve basic pacemaker stability. We will cover the concepts of quorum, clone resources, resource constraints, and why STONITH fencing is a requirement for the environment.
