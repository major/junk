The Policy Engine: Managing Permissions in OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation explains how to implement proper user- and permission management in OpenStack. Clouds have certain requirements when it comes to user- and permission management: A hard separation of individual projects is necessary â€” and it must work reliably. In OpenStack, the built-in policy engine is responsible for defining and enforcing access levels. While things seem great at a first glance, a closer look brings a number of challenges to light. This presentation gives a basic introduction into the OpenStack permission model and how policy enforcement works for the individual services. It will elaborate on a number of issues of the current implementation and will show ways to address them. If you want to know why using the OpenStack default policy files may not be a good idea, this presentation is for you.
