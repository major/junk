Early Performance testing of Openstack Cloud using an Automated performance test framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As we are building value add services in the openstack cloud and functional testing them build on build, it is also critical to performance test those new APIs or functions earlier in the cycle. The performance bottlenecks and the performance trends of APIs build over build are identified using an automated performance test framework that covers deployment to reporting.        In this presentation we will cover:Automated deployment of the performance test bed using AnsiblePerformance test cases for the services (API/Component level) under testHow to Integrate the performance test cases in a CI environmentHow to measure the performance metrics build on build and generate trend graphs in automated fashion
