**Abstract:**

eBay Inc. has one of the largest deployments of Openstack clouds and has been at the forefront of deploying Openstack in several environments that include eBay MarketPlaces, development, analytics and QA environments. In this talk we present the challenges faced in integrating with nova LXD to serve our massive muti-tenant cloud needs and our architecture and solutions to address them. We will go through our topology, deployment patterns, migration, feature implementations and enhancements to Openstack Nova LXD. Some of the areas we will discuss are listed below: Brief overview of the cloud architecture at eBay LXD onboarding and deployment process LXC Instance resize and migration Overlay (SDN environment) and Bridge Networking Monitoring and Remediation LXC Instance booting on remote volume Version compatibility with other components LXD vs Docker We will conclude with our observations and best practices recommendations.
