DevOps on Cisco Metapod OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

TCS & Cisco Metapod team shall share key learnings & advantages of DevOps on Metapod as part of this session. Cisco Metapod is an OpenStack based cloud that is integrated with TCS’s DevOps framework. TCS has on-boarded several open source tools for requirements management, source code configuration management, build, test and deployment and monitoring. All these tools are pre-integrated to give a seamless Continuous integration, delivery and deployment environment and the framework uses OpenStack API to instantiate virtual sand boxes for build, test and deployment. The framework leverages OpenStack HEAT templates, Nova, Cinder and Ceilometer API to provide the cloud customers the possibility of automated CI/CD environment. The framework is fully containerized using Docker. The framework is flexible to work on KVM based virtual machine environment and is future ready with support for Docker container based virtualization
