It’s Installed! Now what? - Day 2 Operations and TripleO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

TripleO was developed to provide the ability to install, upgrade, and operate OpenStack clouds using OpenStack's own cloud facilities as the foundation. As OpenStack and TripleO continue to mature, we can leverage their feature sets to solve more complex operational tasks.   This session aims to walk through common Day 2 Operational scenarios you might encounter with an Openstack installation deployed with TripleO and provide attendees the answers to implementing tasks such as: Backing up and restoring your undercloud Restoring a failed overcloud node Applying configuration customisations via TripleO Keeping your overcloud current with the latest packages Scaling out your cloud
