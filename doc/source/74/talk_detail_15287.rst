Supercharging Heat with the Open Patterns Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Heat orchestration templates are very useful on their own, but combine them with Salt for configuration management, Git for source code management, a media library for binary files, a graphical/text editor for your source code, and a runtime management system for "day two" operations and you have something that truly supercharges Heat.  We call this powerful combination of technologies the Open Patterns Engine. By an "open pattern" we are speaking of a means for using open technologies to describe the OS images, application software, configuration management scripts, and orchestration steps that go together to deploy and manage a software stack.  These patterns provide a way to treat infrastructure as code.  We call the engine that interprets these patterns the Open Pattern Engine.  Our presentation will describe and demonstrate how you can put the Open Pattern Engine we've built to use, or learn how you can build a similar one of your own.
