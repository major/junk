Downstream Gate - How to set up and run pre-merge, gating CI using OpenStack CI tooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, we'll show how to set up the OpenStack CI tooling to run tests "downstream", i.e., after code has merged upstream. Everyone is talking about CI/CD pipelines these days. But "CI/CD" means a lot of different things to different people. We'll demonstrate techniques that bring the powerful OpenStack continuous integration (CI) tooling to benefit Cloud Operators. Learn how these tools allow you to run CI to test your specific deployment with the exact code you plan to deploy to production....before the proposed changes to deployment tooling or local patches are even merged into your local code repository.  Once you are able to run CI in this manner, continuous deployment (CD) can be achieved with a much higher confidence level.
