Is it still raining? Getting weather reports from the clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Weather has been a blackbox for ages until humanity learned how to observe and measure it's certain aspects. It was not until August of 1861 that the first ever weather report was published in The Times, giving people knowledge about conditions outside and allowing to plan their adventures a bit ahead of time. Luckily enough, we do not have to wait another century to be able to take a peek into today's clouds. OpenStack gives us a vast number of resources to master and for every successful cloud deployment it is crucial to know the resources at hand. Having this knowledge helps to plan ahead and adapt to ever changing conditions, wether it is a sunny Saturday's afternoon or Monday's heavy storms.This presentation takes focus on methods for metric processing and taking preemptive actions to avoid potential downtime. It covers key metrics and data points on the example of Nova and Cinder services. We will take a look into existing solutions, both from a big tent and from outside.
