Anatomy Of OpenStack Neutron through the eagle eyes of troubleshooters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The anatomy of an OpenStack project is different when looked at from the perspective of different roles, such as developers, system administrators, and support engineers (troubleshooters), etc. While a developer prefers to concentrate on certain areas of the code, an architect perceives the project as different pieces that need to be reconciled. System administrators and support engineers have to see both worlds when it comes to troubleshooting.In this session, you’ll learn the anatomy of OpenStack Neutron troubleshooting from the point of view of a system administrator and a support associate. We’ll discuss how a Neutron looks when we hit an issue, and how we troubleshoot to isolate the problem to a specific component. We’ll explain these challenges using examples from real troubleshooting production issues.
