Continuous Documentation for OpenStack Resources with RedHat and Atlassian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How can I make software-architecture documentation available to all stakeholders in a project and which best practices make this easier? How does autmoated documentation work in the Age of DevOps? That is the question that we are trying to discuss with the community at large and answer on a practical level – using arc42 (http://www.arc42.org) as a framework and the toolsets provided by our partners Atlassian and Redhat - with an open source project for Continuous Documentation (or ConDoc) for short, which we at NetworkedAssets started last October. By the time you’ll see this presentation we will be able to present our DoS (Documentation from System Configuration) module, which focuses on deployments on RedHat OpenStack and RedHat OpenShift Enterprise (= Docker/Kubernetes, running on top of RedHat OpenStack) and the community home that we created for this project (outside of Github and our own website).
