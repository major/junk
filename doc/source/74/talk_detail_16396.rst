Your Cloud Architecture in Yoga Pants: Staying Flexible Over Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today OpenStack has become a powerful, extremely flexible platform that can fit a lot of different needs and use cases. There are specialized OpenStack deployments for NFV and for e-commerce. Clouds that host production workloads and clouds intended for developers. But most OpenStack clouds whether big or small have one trait in common: they change. More often than not, OpenStack clouds grow as they pick up new workloads. They add or swap out hardware and upgrade underpinning software.  They get tasked with new requirements or different constraints around uptime or performance.  They add new projects from upstream, or change backends for existing projects.  Given time, almost every dimension of an OpenStack cloud is subject to change. So since there’s no one-size-fits-all deployment architecture, it’s clear that you’ll need your cloud to evolve with you In this talk, we’ll dive into our experiences with changing deployment architecture on production clouds.
