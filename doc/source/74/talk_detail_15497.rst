**Abstract:**

  Pacemaker is being used to manage core services in many OpenStack installations (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Suse, Mirantis, and others). For operators who wish to be more familiar with its inner workings, this talk will go over Pacemaker's architecture and basic troubleshooting steps. We will cover troubleshooting approaches, log analysis, and the architecture of Pacemaker itself.
