Day 2 Operations: How To Constantly Improve The Upgrade Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How do you upgrade OpenStack regions of thousands of hypervisors without your users noticing? Better yet, how do you do it at regular intervals that follow community releases?Even though everybody's doing OpenStack upgrades these days, it’s still not trivial, or even easy to do. In an ideal world, you'd be able to upgrade the packages with changes to the config files or start new Docker images, apply a new database schema, and making sure everything works. Easy, right?Unfortunately, the real­life scenario is way more complex. This session will detail about how we constantly improve our Openstack upgrade process at Symantec.
