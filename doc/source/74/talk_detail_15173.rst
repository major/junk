It's Not Working, What Now?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Serviceability is an awkward term, and implies that something needs to be fixed -- a situation none of us wants to find ourselves in. But all software has bugs, and all hardware breaks at some point, and so we need to know what to do when the inevitable happens.Serviceability is a design goal: how can each of the projects in the OpenStack ecosystem maximize the ease with which problems are identified, isolated and resolved? What has been done to date, and what can we do to continue and extend the process(es) already in place?Join HPE Distinguished Technologist Harry Sutton in an exploration of these questions, and join the discussion around how to keep your OpenStack environment running with a minimum of disruption.
