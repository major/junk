Datacenter Automation Through Continuity: A Cloud in a Box.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Datacenter infrastructures are not homogenous systems, which create unique challenges for automation of Openstack as an End-to-End (E2E) installation process on bare metal servers.  New hardware, disaster recovery, and failed upgrade processes require a quick and seamless process to deploy new or augment existing environments and code levels. Installation of Openstack on new bare metal servers is a time consuming process, which involves: hardware configuration, installation of the OSP utility hypervisor, and manual data collection and configuration prior to beginning the ironic introspection process.  Through the combined use of IPAM, OSP, and CloudForms; greater efficiencies can be gained by automating hardware, network, and flavor provisioning.  Session attendees will learn strategies to further automate the deployment of OpenStack across new and existing bare metal servers to create an extensible solution for new deployments, failed upgrades, and disaster recovery scenarios.
