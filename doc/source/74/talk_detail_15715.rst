OpenStack sizing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At the Tokyo summit, we covered how to size OpenStack based on standard metrics and user experience. But what about retrieving accurate data from the environment? We finally have tools that provide that information, along with guidelines based on your own environment about the status, the trend, how many virtual machines can we handle, etc.

In 2010 he changed his area to Cloud environments and he has been collaborating in the design and architecture on several Private and Public clouds working with a System Integrator, and got involved in different projects, one of them was OpenStack. Since then, he tried to integrate OpenStack with the existing technologies as well to understand how OpenStack fits in the current Customer's ecosystem as an Architect In 2014 he joined Canonical to expand the architecture of their products and add his expertise to the business, as well as complex architecture's integration experiences By the end of 2015 he left Canonical but he is still interested on OpenStack and following the community very closely)*
