It is a twisted path from setting a tripleo heat template value to setting configuration setting on a client server. Â  This presentation will detail the data flow path from setting a value in a heat template to the application of configuration parameters with client puppet modules. This presetnation will use actual configuration options and follow the data path through the heat stack and onto the client machine.
