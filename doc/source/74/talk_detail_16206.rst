Openstack and Infrastructure High Availability for a Production deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most of the production installations do need High Availability on both openstack side and Infrastructure side. Most of the implementations are done today considering openstack 'is highly available' and will take care of it.This may not be always true. A failure can happen on VM, Server, disk, network, switches anywhere apart from any glitches/bugs with openstack services. A case study of deploying a production openstack with HA and study done by faults injected at component and infra level will be shown.A topology of multiple Cisco UCS Fabrics and domains along with switches in the infra along with multiple controllers, hypervisors and ceph nodes spread across these domains and achieving HA will be revealed.
