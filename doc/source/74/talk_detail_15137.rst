~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, we discuss best practices and performance tuning for OpenStack cloud storage with Ceph to achieve high availability, durability, reliability and scalability at any point of time.  Also discuss best practices for failure domain, recovery, rebalancing, backfilling, scrubbing, deep-scrubbing and operations priority to get high availability and maximum throughput along with maximum IO operations.  It also includes performance tuning for Nova, Cinder, Glance and Swift projects.
