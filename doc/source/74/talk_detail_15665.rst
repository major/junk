How to Deploy to an OpenStack Cloud and Create a Highly Effective Team Along the Way 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The real reason organizations want OpenStack is to run applications, but having an OpenStack Cloud at their disposal is just the beginning. There is configuration management, automation, containers, and wealth of other interesting technologies to choose from. What's more, organizations have old legacy apps sitting behind their firewalls that just won't go away.  In this session, I'll dive deep into best practices and the fundamental questions organizations need to answer to successfully and reliably go from code to production on an OpenStack cloud. I'll talk about the real-world deployment of Designate on Rackspace Public Cloud to manage its legacy DNS infrastructure. I'll provide some concise examples of how to make sure that both the dev team and operators have a clear conceptual model of what environments look like, how to update them, and the best practices that ensure organizations can go from a single cloud server to managing an entire cluster along side legacy infrastructure.
