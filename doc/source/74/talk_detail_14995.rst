Writing A New Puppet OpenStack Module Like A Rockstar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying OpenStack is a complex task, and Puppet modules for OpenStack bring scalable and reliable IT automation to OpenStack cloud deployments. Puppet modules enable you to deploy most OpenStack services, some that you already know, like Nova and Neutron, but also new projects, like Octavia and Mistral. Puppet OpenStack maturity helped us learn from our successes and mistakes each time we had to write a new module. In this presentation, we’ll share these learnings and teach you how to successfully write a new Puppet module that’s compliant, tested, consistent, and ready for production deployments.
