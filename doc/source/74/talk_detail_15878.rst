Datacenter Genesis: A Datamodel for Mastering Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

“Your new datacenter: the final deployment.These are the steps of your favorite automation tool.It’s mission: to install bare machines, to deploy new Ceph clusters and a new OpenStack installation, to boldly establish new networks and tenants where no man has provisioned a VNF before.” In a not too distant future no datacenter operator will ponder on questions such as: “How was everything designed?” or “What is the origin of this deployment?” This is because of the universally adopted use of a standard for describing datacenter deployments. Today, however, a common datamodel is missing that is understood by different automation tools. This talk will thus: * motivate the need for a tool-agnostic datamodel that covers the various aspects of datacenter deployments * highlight the many benefits when adopting such a model * and last but not least: present an approach that builds on top of established projects.
