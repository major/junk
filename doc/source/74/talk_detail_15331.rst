Deep performance tuning with Intel Resource Director Technology to make sure the QOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In a NFV environment, we need to guarantee VNF nodes quick response to provide high quality service. Currently, no good solutions yet. Intel® Resource Director Technology (RDT) provides the hardware framework for monitoring and control of shared data center resources. It includes Cache Allocation/Monitoring Technology (CAT/CMT),  Memory Bandwidth Allocation/Monitoring (MBA/MBM) etc. With these help, we will have good control for our cache, memory bandwidth resource, we can reserve resource for much more import workload such as for an NVF node, import data base server etc. As also RDT provides resource monitors we could use it to monitor resource usage on all OpenStack cluster which will provide a new metric for the cluster administrator to measure cluster. In this session, we will share an experience how we use RDT on OpenStack to control cache/memory bandwidth in our routine testing environment, which help use to immensely improve the work efficiency.
