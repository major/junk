Instance Level QOS tiers for services provided by OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Private or Public OpenStack providers operate in a very fast-growing and internal/external competitive market, always looking for an edge â€“ a way to offer differentiated services with exceptional efficiency with their clouds. You can increase your user stickiness and stand apart from other cloud offerings by offering guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for each service tier on storage level, despite highly unpredictable customer workloads. We'll discuss how users have kept smaller hardware footprint with the cloud hypervisor heterogeneity and propelled the growth of their cloud usage .
