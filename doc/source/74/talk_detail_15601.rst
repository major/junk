Keep your workload up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the perfect world everyone runs cloud-native application in their data centers, even external customers in public clouds. However, the real world is not perfect and most of VMs are treated as Cowcats or Pets. But what if it comes to situation where you will really need to keep your workload up? In our talk we will explain two primary mechanisms offered by OpenStack, which are evacuation and live-migration. Both are here to help you deal with problems that your VMs, nodes or even a datacenter might hit. We will show you different use cases that OpenStack can handle in order to minimize possible downtime that your workload can struggle with. We will share best practices and explain the difference during a live demo.

For about a year he was working on resolving pet vs cattle problems by providing and testing mechanisms that would be able to automatically resurrect lost instances. Additionally he was involved in detecting noisy neighbours VMs and have general interest in distributed systems topics. Dawid has an engineering degree in IT from Gdańsk University of Technology in Poland, where he currently lives. In his free time, he transforms into board game geek, spending all evening around the table.)*

Currently he works full-time on the upstream OpenStack activities, with primary focus on “Win the Enterprise” effort. He is a member of nova team and a member of live migration subteam. Apart from that Pawel is interested in performance optimizations. In his free time he loves to ride a bike and travel over the world.)*
