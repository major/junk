CI/CD testing of OpenStack releases before moving to Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack releases cycles are very fast and staying up to date with the latest release is a very daunting task. Many companies struggle keeping their OpenStack deployments up to date due to lack of time, development environment to test, the tools or methodologies to validate your environment against the newer version. There are a number of well know projects that automate the deployments but it is difficult to set up and track the results. In this talk, you will learn how Rackspace has partnered with Red Hat leveraging their Distributed Continuous Integration (DCI) product to provide CI/CD testing of new versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform to our customers. This allows us to replicate customer environments and testing things like upgrade through automation. It will also share those results with Red Hat to help create and track issues. In this presentation, you will learn how Rackspace is leveraging Red Hat DCI Platform to help you organize and track the results of your tests.
