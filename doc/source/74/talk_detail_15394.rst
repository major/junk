Reality check for OpenStack and CloudFoundry: Perfect Marriage or Divorce in the Making
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud Foundry is an open source PaaS that provides a choice of clouds, developer frameworks and application services. With Cloud Foundry, a developer can easily and quickly build, test, deploy and scale micro-service applications. OpenStack IaaS and CloudFoundry PaaS is considered by some to be a perfect marriage. But as in any marriage, there are many challenges and hardships we need to overcome in order to be successful. This session will explore the deployment process and share the most common challenges with storage, networking, API connectivity, etc. that users will face during the deployment process as well as how to troubleshoot them. We will also discuss how the Cloud Foundry uses BOSH to deploy, manage and monitor the life cycle of distributed applications and how everything ties together with OpenStack. Are OpenStack and Cloud Foundry a match made in heaven? Come find out in this session.
