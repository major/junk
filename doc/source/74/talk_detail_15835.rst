Performance Evaluation of Swift-Hummingbird and All Flash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As IoT and BIGdata progresses, high performance for PUT/GET small objects(n KB to n*10 KB) is needed for object storages. This presentation shows improved throughput performance of Hummingbird with NVMe, ten times as faster as that of Swift. Moreover, Hummingbird with NVMe is able to solve the performance cliff problem cased by the cache mishit due to the lack of available memory.
