Top Considerations for Migrating Your Databases to OpenStack: Loading Data into Trove
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the challenges faced when migrating data to OpenStack is how to get it into a newly provisioned database. Many database engines have platform-specific tools for loading large amounts of data in a more efficient way than just using inserts. However these tools are often not usable in an OpenStack environment, therefore the solution to loading data into Trove is not a trivial one. This talk will cover the techniques and best practices that can be employedÂ to solve this problem.
