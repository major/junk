Building AT&T’s Integrated Cloud: How to implement a custom architecture using Fuel Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Fuel is a great tool to deploy clouds in an user friendly way with the added bonus of having a flexible plugin engine and deployment task graph. In this talk, members of the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) Fuel Automation team demonstrate how to achieve a target state architecture that differs from the out-of-the-box one deployed by OpenStack Fuel. Through a technical demonstration, we intend to show how to create a Fuel plugin that distributes OpenStack services across multiple node roles, integrates third party plugins that enable features like Contrail and how to manipulate the deployment task graph.
