Connecting Cloud Platforms: Federating Access and Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack can evolve to attract more cloud application development by simplifying base services required by most applications. User, roles, access management are among the services which are common requirements for all applications. However, these base requirements for Identity Access Management are complicated by the fact that enterprises need identity federation and common access management. Configuring Keystone for Identity Federation is a well known concept, but it is only half the picture. Configuring Keystone to also use a common access management solution brings OpenStack closer to the proposition that application developers simply drop-in their core business value.  Overview the benefits of connecting a centralized security policy and control point to keystone. We will detail our vendor neutral implementation along with how to tips and lessons.
