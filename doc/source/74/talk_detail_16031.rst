Continuously Battle Tested OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You run into this problem with your own applications everyday. You’ve got a great CI/CD process, with robust gate tests, but you still see issues appear once code gets to production. In your own applications you are lucky, you can deploy a hotfix to remedy the issue in minutes. That doesn’t translate to your OpenStack environment does it? You aren’t set up to continuously deploy OpenStack, and you can’t afford an army of OpenStack experts to track and merge any bugs that might occur when OpenStack is put in real world, production situations. Well the Ops Team at the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) is here to help. We’ve developed a multi-node reference implementation and are constantly testing it with current upstream code. That means we discover OpenStack’s production and scale bugs so that you don’t have to. We publish all the tests we perform and file and follow all the bugs we find. This means a more reliable OpenStack release for you.
