Tuning and optimization of openstack shared services - RabbitMQ and DBs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Tuning and optimization of openstack shared services Rabbitmq and Galera DB clusters.One of the key ingredients for having good openstack cloud is deploying shared services on scale with proper configurations and plugins available for higher performance and running on scale. This presentation will show performance validated and tested configuration options for the openstack most common messaging service. Also will touch some HA proxy best practices. Will take a dive in some of the plugins like shoveler for reducing manual/scripts load on supporting the system.
