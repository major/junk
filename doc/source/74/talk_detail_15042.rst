Put applications/NFV performance optimization intelligence into your cloud.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We believe not all environments behaving the same. As private cloud owner, Having an infrastructure that is flexible enough to be configured in different models is likely the right direction to enable and empower your own applications, at the end, what we want enable is all about how application perform, and how our business perform based on all server side optimizations we are doing. In this talk, we will explore multiple options within modern operating system which potentially give us opportunities to fine tune system performance in addition to generic cloud interface based on VM characteristics, we will also share the way we are doing in Cisco WebEx cloud incubation to achieve the goal of VM performance optimization, and also share the result and recommendation with the people who care more about applications than fancy cloud features.
