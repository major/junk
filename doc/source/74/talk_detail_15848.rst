Customizing the TripleO-deployed OpenStack cloud configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

TripleO is a great deployment tool, but it can seem very complex initially. For most administrators, the learning curve is steep. In this session, we’ll discuss how to configure a cinder backend, enable multipath support, and set simple parameters -- like file descriptor limit in Rabbit MQ. You’ll also learn how to customize configuration of OpenStack services, such as keystone, nova, and neutron, using configuration classes and ExtraConfig.
