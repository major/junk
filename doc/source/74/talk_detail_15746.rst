Documentation Belongs in DevOps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At IBM Blue Box, our entire documentation process is completely integrated into the DevOps environment, using the same tools our software developers use. This best practice ensures that the most accurate information is delivered in the most efficient and timely way from engineering directly to operations and support staff, and also to our customers, thus saving everyone lots of time and energy. This is a simpler process than the OpenStack documentation process, so the learning curve is easier, but the results are excellent. It is highly suitable for a corporate team.
