Challenges and Solutions of customizing Horizon for Enterprise Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NTT Communications has been providing Enterprise Cloud 2.0 (ECL2.0) as public cloud service since March/01 2016, which is currently available across 5 regions by July 2016 and planned to expand up to 14 regions in the near future. ECL2.0 is developed based on OpenStack and consists of a variety of independent micro-services with well-defined APIs. Our team is responsible for developing the customer portal by customizing Horizon and supplementing applications for non-compatible services. In addition to the web-based GUI system, recently there have been increasing requirements of advanced interfaces for high-level resource orchestration and performance analysis in the company, which also leads to the needs of CLI/SDK for batch access and management of service APIs. This presentation describes the design and architecture of the across region GUI portal, as well as CLI/SDK and other information publishing components in ECL2.0.
