Navigating in OpenStack: source of truth about everything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you ever tried, for example,  to find the list of projects to be able to compare them by their role for the ecosystem? How many application catalogs or installation tools do we have? There are a lot of questions related to the entirety of the ecosystem. That’s why we started the project to create an interactive map of projects. We hope that this initiative will be the first step to create the user-friendly navigation system for current experienced Stackers and for new beings. By the way, such a tool is very important thing to attract new members to the OpenStack Community. We already mentioned this point in the article about OpenStack Day in Israel [1]. OpenStack community has an opportunity to find a right way to help everyone to navigate through that maze. And frankly speaking that’s the only chance for all of us to keep growing without losing the general high-level view of the ecosystem.
