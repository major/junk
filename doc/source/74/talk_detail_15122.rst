Galera Cluster - The Highly Available Database Behind OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A recent survey shows that Galera Cluster is the de-facto standard for high-availability of the OpenStack back-end database, protecting Keystone, Nova and Neutron data. This talk will describe the things that are important to know about this critical infrastructure component. In this session, we will discuss:* The role of Galera Cluster as part ofÂ the back-end OpenStack infrastructure;* The way Galera operates and how it achieves active-active, multi-master high availability;* The tools that are available for monitoring Galera, the important metrics to watch and the situations that can arise operationally;


* **Philip Stoev** *(Philip Stoev is QA and Release Manager with Galera Cluster, responsible for the overall quality of the product.
