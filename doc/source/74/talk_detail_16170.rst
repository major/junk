Tips and tricks to making your instances highly maintainable and available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Instance migration is a requirement for any highly available OpenStack deployment and can help to significantly reduce downtime for a cloud’s customers. Migration is important for several reasons: During maintenance work, instances need to be moved to different hypervisors. Resource constraints may make it necessary to move virtual machines to specific hardware. Automated solutions are needed to recover instances in case bare metal machines fail without warning. This presentation will explain the differences between the different forms of migration and evacuation. Administrators will learn how to avoid common pitfalls by applying good practices from the start. Troubleshooting migration has its own challenges. Through different use cases, attendees will learn how to identify and fix typical problems which occur before or after failed migrations, such as resource constraints and database problems.

I am currently specializing in all aspects of OpenStack and Ceph Cloud Storage. I specifically provide OpenStack support for all components of the stack, including Horizon, Neutron, Cinder, Glance, Nova as well as the supporting software such as MariaDB/MySQL with Galera, MongoDB, HAProxy, RabbitMQ and Pacemaker.  Due to the nature of the cloud, a lot of support includes collaborating closely with the OpenStack development engineers.)*
