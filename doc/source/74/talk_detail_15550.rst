OpenStack Troubleshooting for beginners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is powerful. And complex. Troubleshooting OpenStack is not always straightforward because the functionality in OpenStack is delivered by several projects/services working together. We believe that while there is a wealth of well-presented documentation on different services in OpenStack there is a clear lack of good knowledge when all the pieces come together in a real world scenario. We believe that with the learnings and experiences we faced in the field on OpenStack deployment we will be able to present the viewer with a clear step by step procedure on tacking most common issues that we face today in OpenStack. This session is going to re-iterate and reinforce the ideas of an experienced OpenStack troubleshooter and will work as a revision session for them.
