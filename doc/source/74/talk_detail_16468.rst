Cisco: Testing strategies for openstack based production cloud platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As part of the Quality Engineering team at Cisco, we have to ensure the quality and stability of the various environments and to find issues before our customers do. In this presentation we will go over the test strategies we use to accomplish this goal.  Our tests include: sanity test ongoing regression test incremental feature test user experience test perf/scale test Much attention is given to perf/scale testing, but housekeeping of production environments has not been previously discussed.Some tests run everyday to mark a baseline, while some tests are run when changes/upgrades are made. Some tests run for comparison, before and after the change window or peak and off peak hours. Also, we test the platform both, as an end user and as an admin. This ensures we hit the same pain points that an end user would hit and any ops issues an admin would see.We will also discuss the vision of automating this, which will be presented to the community separately.

Responsible for ensuring the quality of the environments before they are made production and since. Testing involves end to end integrated solution testing of the entire cloud platform of which Openstack is a huge part.  Attended the Austin summit with hopes of getting some information on the testing procedures used by various companies. Received very few pointers. Now that we have a built strategy we would like to share that at the next summit. )*
