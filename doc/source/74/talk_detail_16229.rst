Cisco: Kraken CI platform - how to strain your code and sleep well at night
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Continuous Integration is the often glossed over link between Operations and Developers. It's simple, but complicated. It's beautiful (when done "right"), but ugly (when done "wrong"). Ultimately, it's the core power behind agile itself.  We plan to bring to light a CI reference model at an enterprise scale, not only delivering Openstack, Containers, ACI, and Bare Metal, but stability, velocity, and a happier more balanced life =).
