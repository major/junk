Keystone and WebSSO: A unified login system for OpenStack and other web services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides the ability to use one login for all of an organization's web services, providing a way to seamlessly sign on to each system rather than using different usernames and passwords for each system. To make this possible, you can configure Openstack Keystone and Horizon for Web Single Sign-on (WebSSO) so the user can log in to the Horizon dashboard using credentials that are authenticated using a remote authentication service. This talk describes how to configure WebSSO on Windows and Linux machines.
