Analyzing OpenStack Performance :  A case study from large scale OpenStack testing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Recently, Intel and VMware conducted a study of OpenStack performance across large number of physical hosts. We deployed an OpenStack Cloud on the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) and ran a few performance testing experiment. In this session we will present our findings from the study, identify key bottlenecks, provide tips on tuning the parameters and guidance on a large-scale deployment architecture. This session will be immensely beneficial to anyone who is planning to run large-scale OpenStack in production.
