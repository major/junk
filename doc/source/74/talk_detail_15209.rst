Managing clusters of thousands of VMs using Senlin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Efficient resource pool management is crucial to achieve high scalability and elasticity in a cloud environment. In this presentation, users from China Mobile will share their experiences on managing thousand of VMs using Senlin service. Topics like integrating Ceilometer/Gnocchi with Senlin to support auto-scaling, optimizing OpenStack services to achieve high concurrency, and deploying Senlin on multiple hosts to support service HA will be discussed.
