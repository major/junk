Analyzing Performance in the Cloud : solving an elastic problem with a scientific approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The exponential growth of cloud computing services has given rise to the need for Industry-standard verifiable techniques that can be used to evaluate the performance of the various cloud offerings. During this session you will learn how to evaluate the performance of your Openstack cloud resources based on methodology developed by Dell and Red Hat. We will share best practices for setting up multiple instances of Dell Red Hat Cloud Solution powered by Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 8 and provide performance tuning tips gathered from running a Big Data workload on an Openstack Cloud. Join us and learn why now, more than ever, the enterprises need representative real-world workloads to measure, analyze and characterize the performance of cloud solutions.
