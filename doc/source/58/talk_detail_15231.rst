Using OpenStack personas to build an effective cloud strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What are user personas in OpenStack? How do they relate to and differ from each other, and what do you need to know about them to provide the best possible user experience? User personas have been an effective method to describe customer needs and expectations for decades. No matter what part of a software product, documentation, or web-site you develop, you should always consider the audience you are targeting. While analyzing OpenStack user personas, we debated a number of possible options and used various techniques, such as analyzing our web-site visitors profiles, as well as feedback from our services and support organizations, in-person interviews, quantitative and qualitative testing. Our main goal was to shift from the “Just deploy OpenStack” mentality to “How do we make our customers successful with OpenStack?”
