Evaluating OpenStack Performance with the SPEC Cloud (TM) IaaS 2016 Benchmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) released in May 2016 SPEC Cloud (TM) IaaS 2016, an industry-standard benchmark that measures performance of IaaS clouds. The SPEC Cloud (TM) IaaS 2016 benchmark was developed by representatives of cloud industry companies who are members of the SPEC organization. The primary metrics measured and reported are scalability, elasticity, and instance provisioning time. The benchmark supports both public and private cloud implementations, can make use of multi-tenancy, and provides much flexibility in how compute instances (physical servers, virtual machines, containers), storage, and networking are configured.
