Any Way You Want It: OpenStack Consumption Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, we will orient new users to the landscape of options for consuming OpenStack infrastructure resources. The session will explain each of the five major consumption models—DIY, distro, converged solution, managed services and public cloud—and the use cases in which each might be the perfect fit for you and your company.  Participants in this session will not only learn about their choices in consuming OpenStack, but they’ll learn how each model has matured as OpenStack and the market has evolved. We’ll also talk about how many enterprises are looking at giving their application developers greater abstraction from having to touch the infrastructure. Attend this session if you’re new to OpenStack and have responsibility for helping your organization design and deploy cloud resources. You’ll leave with a clear model of how to evaluate the diverse OpenStack consumption models available to you.
