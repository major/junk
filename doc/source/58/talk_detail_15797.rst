Introducing OpenStack to a Traditional Infrastructure Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Introducing open source technology can be a daunting task within a traditional infrastructure team. So, how does an individual contributor within an infrastructure team begin to expose his peers to OpenStack and related technologies? Exposing peers to an unfamiliar technology and a new way to manage and deploy infrastructure and resources can be a challenge. In this talk, we will explore how to engage peers in discussing OpenStack and related technologies. First, I will discuss ways to initially expose peers to OpenStack. We’ll discuss ways in which OpenStack can simplify a traditional infrastructure team’s ability to deliver a higher quality of service and support to end users. Next, we will take a look at discovering where OpenStack can best benefit a legacy infrastructure team future direction. Finally, we will discuss ways to identify opportunities for OpenStack deployments to ensure success.
