Interop? You Keep Using That Word, I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Increasingly, interoperability is the focus of conversation as we enter the era of multi cloud. Still up for debate though, is where exactly this compatibility should be focused: at the infrastructure or orchestration level? For example, at the infrastructure layer, the ability to perform actions between clouds using Federated Keystone to operate one cloud from another was demonstrated in Vancouver at the OpenStack Summit 2015. At the orchestration layer, we can focus on the interoperability of tools like Terraform and Heat across different clouds to achieve interoperability of your workloads. We’d also like to explore some interesting workload-based scenarios for demonstrating interoperability at both the infrastructure and orchestration levels (as guided by DefCore and tested by RefStack). Which path will lead to driving different clouds to support similar features while also providing the right feedback to the ecosystem? Join us for a spirited discussion!

The RackN team has deep knowledge of Kubernetes (we've been deploying it on clouds and metal), OpenStack (we created the Crowbar project) and cloud native architecture (we migrated Digital Rebar to be micro-services). Basically, Rob has deep ops knowledge of both platforms AND experience with cloud native migrations. He's also a regular speaker at OpenStack Summits about items including SDN, interop and running Kubernetes. You can read more about my thoughts and positions regarding OpenStack and Cloud on my blog: http://RobHirschfeld.com.)*
