Hard facts behind “Software-Defined” - What it means, and How to enable your business
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We have all heard that “software-defined” is the future, if not the present, of the data center.But what does software-defined really mean, where did it come from, and what are its technology and business implications?Which parts of the data center can you define with software, and what are the risks? What will it cost, and how long will it take? What are your options for getting up and running quickly? These are just a few of the questions we face. In this session, SUSE and Midokura team up to present the current state of the software-defined data center, and provide a concrete framework to determine whether and when to move forward.We discuss how software-define applies to compute, storage, and networking, and how OpenStack gets you on the path to SDDC.We present use cases from real enterprise deployments, and recommendations on getting started, a path to deployment, and typical gotchas.
