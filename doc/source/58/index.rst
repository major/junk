Evaluating OpenStack
====================

Any Way You Want It: OpenStack Consumption Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, we will orient new users to the landscape of options for consuming OpenStack infrastructure resources. The session will explain each of the five major consumption models—DIY, distro, converged solution, managed services and public cloud—and the use cases in which each might be the perfect fit for you and your company.  Participants in this session will not only learn about their choices in consuming OpenStack, but they’ll learn how each model has matured as OpenStack and the market has evolved. We’ll also talk about how many enterprises are looking at giving their application developers greater abstraction from having to touch the infrastructure. Attend this session if you’re new to OpenStack and have responsibility for helping your organization design and deploy cloud resources. You’ll leave with a clear model of how to evaluate the diverse OpenStack consumption models available to you.

Using OpenStack personas to build an effective cloud strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What are user personas in OpenStack? How do they relate to and differ from each other, and what do you need to know about them to provide the best possible user experience? User personas have been an effective method to describe customer needs and expectations for decades. No matter what part of a software product, documentation, or web-site you develop, you should always consider the audience you are targeting. While analyzing OpenStack user personas, we debated a number of possible options and used various techniques, such as analyzing our web-site visitors profiles, as well as feedback from our services and support organizations, in-person interviews, quantitative and qualitative testing. Our main goal was to shift from the “Just deploy OpenStack” mentality to “How do we make our customers successful with OpenStack?”

MythBusting OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We've all heard people say things like, "OpenStack is a competitor to AWS and VMware," or "OpenStack is a turnkey cloud solution," or even "OpenStack kills and replaces your virtual infrastructure solution."  While it's true that OpenStack provides a solution for many people with many different interests and goals, there are some obstacles that we need to be vigilant about pushing back on. After working with many OpenStack customers we have realized that in many cases the reality is not meeting the expectations and we want to help make a clear separation for everyone's benefit. It is important for new stackers to understand the realities, separate them from the myths, and recognize how it can really help them.  In addition of debunking myths, we will illustrate how stackers can bring a new set of realities and possibilities back to their teams, developers and organization. Based on our experience, these key takeaways will help you bring some of the misconceptions to reality.

Hard facts behind “Software-Defined” - What it means, and How to enable your business
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We have all heard that “software-defined” is the future, if not the present, of the data center.But what does software-defined really mean, where did it come from, and what are its technology and business implications?Which parts of the data center can you define with software, and what are the risks? What will it cost, and how long will it take? What are your options for getting up and running quickly? These are just a few of the questions we face. In this session, SUSE and Midokura team up to present the current state of the software-defined data center, and provide a concrete framework to determine whether and when to move forward.We discuss how software-define applies to compute, storage, and networking, and how OpenStack gets you on the path to SDDC.We present use cases from real enterprise deployments, and recommendations on getting started, a path to deployment, and typical gotchas.

Introducing OpenStack to a Traditional Infrastructure Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Introducing open source technology can be a daunting task within a traditional infrastructure team. So, how does an individual contributor within an infrastructure team begin to expose his peers to OpenStack and related technologies? Exposing peers to an unfamiliar technology and a new way to manage and deploy infrastructure and resources can be a challenge. In this talk, we will explore how to engage peers in discussing OpenStack and related technologies. First, I will discuss ways to initially expose peers to OpenStack. We’ll discuss ways in which OpenStack can simplify a traditional infrastructure team’s ability to deliver a higher quality of service and support to end users. Next, we will take a look at discovering where OpenStack can best benefit a legacy infrastructure team future direction. Finally, we will discuss ways to identify opportunities for OpenStack deployments to ensure success.

Interop? You Keep Using That Word, I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Increasingly, interoperability is the focus of conversation as we enter the era of multi cloud. Still up for debate though, is where exactly this compatibility should be focused: at the infrastructure or orchestration level? For example, at the infrastructure layer, the ability to perform actions between clouds using Federated Keystone to operate one cloud from another was demonstrated in Vancouver at the OpenStack Summit 2015. At the orchestration layer, we can focus on the interoperability of tools like Terraform and Heat across different clouds to achieve interoperability of your workloads. We’d also like to explore some interesting workload-based scenarios for demonstrating interoperability at both the infrastructure and orchestration levels (as guided by DefCore and tested by RefStack). Which path will lead to driving different clouds to support similar features while also providing the right feedback to the ecosystem? Join us for a spirited discussion!
