Openly Shift on Stack - Value of OpenShift on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has become the defacto Open Standard for IaaS. At the same time OpenShift is a containerization platform built based on Open Standards such as Open Container Initiative, Kubernetes etc.  While OpenStack and OpenShift are two separate opensource products that don't depend on each other, when they work together a natural symbiotic relationship between these two technologies gives a feeling that they are made for each other.  In this session, we will discuss the current IT landscape, IT trends, issues that Enterprise IT is trying to solve and how OpenStack and OpenShift together address these issues.
