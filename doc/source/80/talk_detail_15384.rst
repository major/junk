Getting Started with OpenStack Python SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Python SDK is designed to improve developer experience by consolidating the various OpenStack python- client libraries and command line interface into a unified, well designed, and user-focused SDK ("Software Development Toolkit"). In this talk, we'd like to discuss what the Python SDK is, how it is designed, and how one can use OpenStack Python SDKs. With a consumer application requiring various individual pythons clients to install, each with different APIs and nuances, it becomes increasingly difficult to consume OpenStack clouds. The python-OpenStack SDK project proposes a new project with a single API namespace ("OpenStack") that would provide users with a single point of entry and series of supporting functions/methods from which to build applications and tools.
