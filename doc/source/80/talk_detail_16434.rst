~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So you've finally got OpenStack installed - either through DIY or you got it though a vendor. But there are still a hundred ways to fail with OpenStack. Now, how do you make the best use of OpenStack to ensure your success as application developers and deployers? In this presentation, we will take you through the challenges and best practices around app development and lifecycle management on top of OpenStack, based on our experiences working with several enterprises. We will cover the strengths and gaps within OpenStack, architecting your applications for OpenStack, developing to the OpenStack APIs, image management, CI/CD, Heat, PaaS etc. Basically, we will discuss topics relevant to any application developer and architect to be able to develop and deploy applications  for OpenStack.
