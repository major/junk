Innovating applications in the Cloud - Results of the Guadalajara OpenStack Cloud Apps Hackathon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Innovating in the applications for the cloud is one of the top priorities for OpenStack. Nowadays, OpenStack is a mature platform which next challenge is to shift its community mindset from "How do I get a running cloud?" to "What can I do with a running cloud?". To accomplish this new approach, OpenStack needs cloud application developers aboard. OpenStack Cloud App Hackathons are a series of events that last a month; where developers, operators, designers, students and entrepreneurs are challenged to develop the best possible cloud based application during a weekend. Participants will be trained by top notch open cloud application developers, guided and mentored by the leaders in the cloud computing industry. The Guadalajara Hackathon is the second one of numerous of worldwide hackathons for building a stronger open cloud community in the region. The hackathon is pursuing innovation and knowledge. But above all, share and increase the number of diverse-open-cross-cloud applications.
