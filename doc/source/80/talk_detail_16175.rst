Heat and Its Alternatives: Application Deployment in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When dealing with the deployment of arbitrarily complex virtual application stacks, OpenStack comes with a highly powerful built-in facility: Heat. However, Heat is not the only way to deploy applications within OpenStack — in this session, we'll look at Heat plus two available alternatives: Juju, and Cloudify. In particular, this session covers the following questions: How can I deploy applications with Heat, Juju, and Cloudify? What architectural assumptions does each tool make? How can I deploy multi-node cloud applications? How specific to OpenStack is each solution? What's my expected learning curve? Having worked with all three tools extensively, we're able to give an unbiased, impartial comparison of all three tools.
