Changes on the Horizon? Diving into Apple's new programming language and the future of UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Apple's new programming language, Swift, which made its first appearance in 2014, has quickly gained popularity. Building cross-platform apps has never been more streamlined! This session will include the history, the basics, and the best practices for UI development. Some of the specific topics include, what this new language means for modern UI development, how it makes use of popular design patterns, the tools used for development, and how it compares to other options available. We will take a look at the strides made in creating Swift frameworks and packages, and more specifically how it could influence Horizon, the official OpenStack Dashboard, going forward.
