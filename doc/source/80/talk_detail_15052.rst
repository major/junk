Building self-healing applications with Aodh, Zaqar and Mistral
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Explore how OpenStack can provide highly-available monitoring of your application at any scale. Automatically scaling and healing applications based on resource/application status or workload is at the heart of the OpenStack value proposition. It is one of the key capabilities that differentiate cloud vs. traditional infrastructure such as VMware. We'll talk about how to make your applications autonomous by using Zaqar to get notifications from an OpenStack cloud and use them to autonomously manage the application's own infrastructure, so that people with pagers sitting in front of monitors and clicking on things don't have to. Then we'll demonstrate how to use new features in OpenStack to build a cloud application that is self-healing in the face of VM failure.

I work full time on OpenStack for Red Hat, mostly on Heat and TripleO. Lately I've been thinking a lot about how we make make sure that OpenStack succeeds at providing a full cloud feature set, not just a better way to launch virtual machines.)*

Lingxian has writen more than 150 technical blogs to introduce features of various OpenStack projects from 2012, helped a lot of students and employees to understand better about OpenStack. Lingxian is aslo the co-founder of Xi'an OpenStack meetup in China,Â He is a highly requested moderator and speaker for a variety of conferences and other events on topics related to OpenStack.)*
