Let's Learn Go!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Let's get together and quickly build an application in Go.  The Go language has exploded in popularity over the past few years as Python programmers, Ruby developers, and systems C programmers have switched over to the language for its ease of learning, relative flexibility, increased performance, and quick compilations. It is a relatively bare bones language without a lot of features, but that means that it's approachable for new developers and that it's very easy to quickly become proficient and productive in it.
