How to build Murano cloud application from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Imagine, you have access to OpenStack cloud and need to spin on some complex workload there. Usually, most parts of workload are common, such as database, web server, proxy and so on. But in real life, it often happens that some important part of picture, like, for example, brand new service written on Go, is missing in the community catalog. How user can deal with it? Murano project suggests a solution. Using Murano, users can build complex cloud environments from ready-made blocks and bake new ones if necessary.
