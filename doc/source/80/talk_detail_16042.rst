Application Catalogs: understanding Glare, Murano and Community App Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack matured and began reaching the upper layers of the Cloud stack, a number of OpenStack projects started working with cloud applications. Soon enough several initiatives emerged to build services which would provide various catalog-like functionality for these apps. The most notable of these initiatives are project Murano, an Openstack big-tent project officially known as "Application Catalog for Openstack", project Glare (aka GLance ARtifact REpository, previously known as Glance v3) and a Community Application Catalog, an initiative backed by Openstack Foundation, hosting some cloud apps at apps.openstack.org.
