Building services on top of Openstack APIs: unleash the power of your applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Since more than 2 years, OVH works to integrate Openstack as the foundation to its new Public Cloud. Because we want to provide the best user experience for each customer who starts his cloud experience in our Public Cloud, we daily work on top of Openstack APIs to develop APIs, tools, workarounds. Openstack APIs are great tools for developers, on which you can easily add value, automatize actions, gain some time, but you can also lose time by trying to understand how it works and how to achieve your goal. Thanks to our 2 years of experience, we will try to demistify through this talk the Openstack APIs, and how to use it, to help you on your first steps as an API developer.
