Monitor and manage your OpenStack cloud on the go!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Technology is advancing rapidly, and the marriage of mobile technology and virtualization is the next cornerstone towards the world of tomorrow. With this in mind, we combined OpenStack, Apple's Swift Language, and mobile devices to help realize how cloud technology will be used in the years to come. With OpenStack mobile, our goal is to bring greater productivity for OpenStack administrators, to bridge the gap between masters and novices of cloud management, and to make the cloud a more seamless part of our daily lives. Mobile accomplishes this by making cloud more accessible and more manageable for all. Key features: Decrease service downtime from anywhere responding to situations immediately from your mobile device Ease of access enhances the user experience for your OpenStack Cloud providing essential tools in a mobile-friendly format Gain control over your cloud computing bottom line using mobile devices to track pertinent environment information and cost consumption
