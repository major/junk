Service Application Building and Maintaining based on Private&Hybrid OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this topic, we will introduce our experience on cloud native service application buildup and maintenance based on OpenStack which includes full life cycled continous delivery, from perspective of software development to service maintenance and daily operating. this include:1. Service functional definition and deployment topology design.2. Packaging source codes to support integration and testing,3. Build management with multiple snapshots supported4. service scale up and node auto-replacement based on OpenStack Heat engine5. A/B testing, old service runtime cooling and taking over to support new runtime bits promotion6. some experience sharing for delivery iterationAnd in order to make the service running happily, which features of OpenStack should be reinforced, which features should be avoided to use.
