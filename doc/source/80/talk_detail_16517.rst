Beyond Horizon: Building custom interfaces with the JavaScript SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn how to use the JavaScript SDK to control OpenStack directly from your web browser. Since the release of Mitaka, OpenStack's services support direct API access from the web browser. This opens the door to a new class of powerful web applications, backed by popular frameworks such as AngularJS and React. This presentation will provide a comprehensive walk through of these features, including the following: How do you configure your Cloud to permit browser access. How do you start a new JavaScript project. How do you configure your project to talk to your cloud. How do you make an API request. How do you authenticate to Keystone. Time permitting, we will also go over the projects' roadmap.
