The Cloud Management Roundup: CMP vs. PaaS vs. Orchestration (Application & Infrastructure)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The goal of all cloud management tools, as the name implies, is to have your application fully managed. There are three subtly different categories that offer tooling for this: PaaS (Platform as a Service), CMP (Cloud Management Platforms), and orchestration tools - where some are better for managing resources (e.g. VMs, data, secrets) and chargeback, when others excel at dev >> test >> build straight from your IDE, while others are standard-driven, e.g. TOSCA, and are targeted at hybrid stacks and environments.
