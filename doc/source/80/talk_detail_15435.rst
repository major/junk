Quick Start Guide for OpenStack developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every year OpenStack receives hundreds of new users and developers. New developers need to start somewhere in order to develop features, automate processes, build tools, execute tests and many other tasks.  This session will provide a few shortcuts and tips to those new individuals in order to help them in their new endeavor. This session will show new Stackers how to create a Python application that uses the software development kits (SDK) already available to them in order to play with OpenStack and show all the results from a self-contained web interface using common open source tools. Creating an application in a short time using open source tools will provide them the confidence they need to add value to the OpenStack community and contribute to the organic grow we expect when everyone is included.
