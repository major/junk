Applications as first-class citizens on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has delivered on the promise of democratizing management of infrastructure layer for operations' teams. But what about application developers? App developers' concern are primarily based around life-cycle management of their applications. Can they deploy applications written in their language of choice on OpenStack? Can they easily configure CI/CD pipelines for their applications? Is it possible to trigger application deployment by pushing code to their applications' repositories? How to achieve resource isolation across application life-cycle stages of test, build, and deploy? Can they define scaling policies? How about choosing containers vs. VMs as application deployment targets? This, and much more is now possible natively on OpenStack. In this talk we present how OpenStack Solum has made applications first-class citizens of OpenStack enabling app developers to abstract away infrastructure in their application development pursuits.

Devdatta's interests are in solving problems for application developers by designing platforms and services that make it easy to design, build, deploy, and manage applications through their life-cycle stages.Currently he is doing that through his work with the Solum project, and previously did that by designing a high-level programming framework for context-aware applications as part of his PhD dissertation research.Devdatta is a published author, having published research papers in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE conferences and journals. He has given talks and presentations at ACM conferences and USENIX workshops, and at the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, Japan. Devdatta earned his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. He is currently teaching a course in modern web application development in the computer science department at the University of Texas at Austin. Â )*
