Metadata search: Finding a needle in OpenStack Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every day, terabytes, if not petabytes, of unstructured data is uploaded into OpenStack Swift. The problem with unstructured data is just that, it’s unstructured. To help empower end-users and make the data more valuable, indexing metadata that resides in Swift makes for a very powerful solution in a large amount of use-cases. Marrying object storage, and it's native metadata capabilities, with indexing technologies like Elasticsearch greatly simplifies and enhances the data and makes it more valuable and actionable. In this session we will provide examples of how to work with metadata in Swift, indexing it all, and searching across your pool of valuable data.
