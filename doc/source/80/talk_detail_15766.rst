Openstack Murano and Puppet: An easy way to bring your manifests into the cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Developing a new Openstack application from scratch can be be challenging. At the same time there are a lot of Puppet code written and published and used in production. In this presentation I want to show an elegant way to reuse your Puppet code for developing applications for Openstack and to tell why and how we use Murano with the Puppet to develop applications and how these tools complement each other.
