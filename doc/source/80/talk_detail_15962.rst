Applications for OpenStack, Developing and Consuming using Community Application Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Now when OpenStack is mature and have it up and running is not a big deal, focus of OpenStack community and customers shifts from "how do I get a running cloud" to "what do I do with running cloud". Variety of applications is huge, from LAMP stacks and legacy Java apps to telco workloads and VNF apps. There is working group which works on a definition of "What is OpenStack application", hopefully community will agree on definition soon. Definition is not yet there, but there is already an integration and distribution point for OpenStack applications, Community Application Catalog (https://apps.openstack.org). There are many applications in the catalog, contributed by OpenStack vendors, Linux and other software vendors and independent contributors.
