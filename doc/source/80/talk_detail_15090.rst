Enabling AWS S3+Lambda-like functionality with OpenStack Swift and OpenWhisk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Does the concept of server-less architecture intrigue you? OpenWhisk (https://git.io/vKeu3) accelerates innovation through creative chaining of microservices into highly scalable applications. By abstracting away infrastructure, OpenWhisk frees small teams to rapidly work on independent pieces of code simultaneously, keeping development focused solely on creating essential business logic.  OpenWhisk allows you to create rules to connect events with actions and compose microservices that get executed independently and in parallel. With a bit of code, you can have OpenWhisk process events from your Swift Object Storage; similar to what you can do with Lambda functions and AWS S3 storage.   As an example, we will demonstrate how you can create an OpenWhisk action to transform an image into a thumbnail whenever a new (larger) image is uploaded into a Swift Container. In this session, we will cover: OpenWhisk and server-less computing Code modifications required A DEMO of it in action!
