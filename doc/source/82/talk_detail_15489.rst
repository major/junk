Turning the Install Guide on its head
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At the Austin summit, there was just one burning issue in the docs camp: The Installation Guide. It had become a problem. The Big Tent changed the way that projects go about joining the OpenStack ecosystem, and with Foundation having an increased focus on ensuring new projects have sufficient documentation, the old way of writing and testing our Install Guide before each release was simply not going to scale any further. There is no ‘right’ way to install an OpenStack cloud, and there are certainly no ‘right’ components to install. But with a small docs team, and a seemingly endless parade of new projects requiring documentation, we were faced with a big technical challenge, and everyone had some kind of skin in the game.This talk covers the problems we faced, the technical and social solutions we devised, and how we implemented them. We also discuss future changes, and how the lessons learned from this project could spread into other areas of the OpenStack docs project.

She has has been playing and working with technology since she discovered the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy text adventure game in the 80's. Eventually, she worked out a way to get paid for her two passions – writing and playing with gadgetry – and has been a technical writer ever since. Right now, she’s working for Rackspace from her home in Brisbane Australia, getting her hands dirty on cloud documentation, and loving every minute of it. She is passionate about open source, cake decorating, and great docs, and is raising her very own geek girl. One day, Lana hopes to write the manual for that, too.)*
