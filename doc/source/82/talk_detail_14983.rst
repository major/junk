The challenge of running OpenStack on AArch64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running OpenStack on a new architecture for which archives are not fully built is challenging. At Linaro we started building packages for OpenStack and trying to build a developer cloud based on OpenStack a while ago. This session is about what we learnt, what we’ve done and what is left to do. We’d like to contribute gate jobs for AArch64, make sure the main distros include the relevant packages to be able to run OpenStack on this architecture and ensure developers out there get access to it to be able to debug/fix any issues in the most architecture inclusive way. We are also making sure that OpenStack on AArch64 is interoperable with other clouds.

OpenStack and Software Defined Infrastructure has been the main target of my work for the past few years. As the SDI Tech Lead at Linaro I am working closely with many different upstream projects and stakeholders to ensure a good user experience of OpenStack on AArch64. )*
