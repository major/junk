Find your Gerrit flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So you are an Openstack engineer which means you are most likely looking at a Gerrit screen on a daily basis. Gerrit is a powerful and very feature rich code review tool with a specific development workflow. It's central to our continuous integration system and we rely on it heavily to automate our workflow. Many people find that Gerrit can be a pleasure to use and others find it to be a grind on their mental health. This talk will attempt to get you out of your funk with Gerrit and get you into a more productive workflow. I will attempt to point out some Gerrit features and tools that might improve your outlook on Gerrit.  Are you aware that there are tools built around Gerrit that can help with creating patches and dashboards?  So, you don't like the Gerrit web UI?  Well I'll demo an alternative UI that you might like.  You don't like the alternative, then I'll run thru some ways you can contribute to improving Gerrit for Openstack.


* **Khai Do** *(I am a software engineer with a passion for improving software quality and delivery. In general I enjoy working on infrastructure projects that help improve software quality. I am an open source enthusiast and enjoy working on FOSS projects related to code review, configuration management, CI/CD, and buid/test automation tools. My typical week consists of reviewing lots of code, improving our infrastructure tools, and managing our vast cloud of VMs to support that infrastructure. I am fairly good at developing, orchestrating, organizing, documenting, testing, and deploying software. While I am most familiar with Java and Python, I am not afraid to learn new programming languages when necessary, or just for fun!.)*
