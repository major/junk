Tour of the OpenStack Project Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every change submitted to the OpenStack project, from code to documentation, goes through a series of tests in the OpenStack Project continuous integration system. It is then reviewed and approved by members of the project and goes through a final series of tests before being merged into the repository. This presentation will guide you through some of the history and rationale for how this system works and provide a high level overview of each of the moving parts in this infrastructure. Common questions like the following and more will be covered: What is Zuul? How are test nodes made available? Where did Jenkins go? What do job configurations look like and how do they work? And much more as this presentation walks you every step of what happens when code is submitted to OpenStack.
