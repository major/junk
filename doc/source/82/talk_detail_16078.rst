The Red Pill for Ironic Third Party CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, a panel of vendors who have set up CI for their Ironic drivers will provide an overview and share their knowledge and discuss experiences in building infrastructure and jobs for Ironic testing that meets the community requirements in the most diverse kinds of underlying environments and how to optimize and scale jobs using real hardware. Come dig deeper into the rabbit hole and get your questions answered.
