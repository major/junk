OpenStack Powered: What is the ideal interoperability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today, multiple OpenStack clouds exist and we have many cloud users in the world. Sometimes, users want to use the other cloud for the cost efficiency or the performance. Then the OpenStack interoperability is important for users, and the OpenStack foundation is providing "OpenStack Powered" program to certificate clouds' interoperability."OpenStack Powered" program is implemented by Tempest which is a test suite. On the first certification, most clouds could pass. However this year, many clouds failed due to a Tempest change. The change has been implemented by the concept of microversion mechanism.This mechanism is considered as common and good for the interoperability in the development community, however it was difficult to share this idea with whole ecosystem completely and we are facing the certification issue and working together with many folks around the ecosystem to solve that.In this session, we will talk about the ideal interoperability and the latest status of this issue.
