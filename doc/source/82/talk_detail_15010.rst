Anatomy of an OpenStack distro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack development process rarely finishes when code is tagged for a release. Throughout the life cycle of a release, OpenStack distributions package, maintain, test, and turn OpenStack into a product that’s easy to consume by a large variety of users on their favorite operating system. In this presentation, you’ll get an inside look at the work that goes into shipping a stable OpenStack distribution on the same day as the upstream release. We will explain how the RDO community distribution continuously packages OpenStack from source, how we test it and how we ship it. We will share our experience, our challenges and how we overcome them in collaboration with the OpenStack community.

He brings his expertise around operations, infrastructure, tooling and CI to ensure RDO is the most stable OpenStack packaging distribution. Previously, he was at iWeb, a server and datacenter infrastructure provider where he held various technical and leadership roles in the span of nearly a decade. In the last years, his focus was around deploying and supporting a highly available multi-region OpenStack public cloud in different datacenters around the world.He holds a blog on https://dmsimard.com where he shares articles about what he learns and his interests.)*

* **Francisco Javier Peña** *(Javier has been involved in the creation of solutions based on Open Source components for more than ten years. Before joining the OpenStack Engineering team at Red Hat, he helped customers design and build clouds based on OpenStack. Now he is contributing to the RDO community by working on the continuous packaging pipeline, the OpenStack Puppet modules and Packstack installer, and he is also involved in the definition of highly available architectures for OpenStack deployments (https://github.com/beekhof/osp-ha-deploy/blob/master/HA-keepalived.md).)*
