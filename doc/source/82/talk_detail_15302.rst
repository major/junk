Analyzing gate failures with subunit2sql, openstack-health and elastic-recheck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will cover how the OpenStack QA team uses subunit2sql to collect information about test results that have run in the gate and how to analyze and use data from gate with openstack-health and elastic-recheck. The resulting data empowers developers in the OpenStack community to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of their tests, identify and track test failures over time and subsequently prioritize which tests they need to prioritize improvements to.Common questions like the following and more will be covered: What is the OpenStack gate? What is subunit2sql? How is subunit2sql used with the gate to collect test results? What is openstack-health? How is data from gate handled with openstack-health? What is elastic-recheck? How is data identified and tracked in elastic-recheck?
