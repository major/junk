Learning How to Create a Horizon AngularJS Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This hands-on lab will introduce you to the Horizon plugin architecture and show you how to create your own AngularJS plugin. Recent enhancements to the plugin architecture has made it even easier to customize or add new content. We will briefly cover all the new extension points in this presentation. We will discuss the benefits of writing a plugin and go over different scenarios of how this architecture can benefit you. We will walk you through step-by-step on how you can write, package, and deploy your plugin. The examples will be made available online at the time of the presentation. This lab is aimed at beginners with some skills in web development. Please come prepared with a laptop and a devstack environment with Horizon installed.
