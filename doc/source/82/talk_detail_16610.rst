Test Tracking and Reporting with OpenStack Health
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a rather powerful and configurable platform, which provides its users with plenty of configurations options and decision to be taken when deploying a cloud. Testing such a complex system requires a lot of automation, in setting up test environments, deploying test clouds, running tests down to collecting and processing test results. Lukily the OpenStack community provides a lot tools to support quality engineering in all of these areas. In this talk I will present how to use OpenStack Health and other related technologies to collect test results from a variety of test teams and test environments, and how to use this data to help your quality organisation in tracking the status and progress of your OpenStack based software.
