Debugging Horizon and Its Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Horizon is the end user facing self-service portal of OpenStack. It is built using Django and is moving towards a lighterweight Angular JS implementation. Horizon is the go to project for operators and is one of the most used projects in production environments. Join us as we will dive through some of the components of the Horizon project and show how to work on the different components of the Horizon projects. We will cover how to debug the Django framework, Angular JS, as well as the Horizon unit tests.
