Vinz, a “viable" alternative to the Gerrit UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have the recent changes to the Gerrit UI left you confused?  Don’t worry, you weren’t alone. From information overload to an over abundance of unintuitive functionality, we decided that there’s gotta be a better way! Join us as we explore the current progress of Vinz, an infra owned Gerrit UI replacement and help guide us by providing feedback on your favorite functionality or current criticisms. Vinz is 100% open source and developed in upstream gerrit.
