A Deep Dive into Customization in Horizon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Horizon is the official OpenStack dashboard providing access to your services via the Web UI. In recent releases, it has developed a robust plugin mechanism with customization at many levels. The goal of this release cycle was to make dashboard development as easy as possible - just one API call and a few lines of code away. Horizon now allows you to easily extend table columns, table actions, filter facets, workflows, detail views, cell templates, and much more!  We will explore all the recent enhancements to this architecture, demo how to make use of them in your dashboard, the best practices for your plugins going forward, and the roadmap for the future. This presentation is accompanied with a sample project for you to experiment with after the session.  Writing a new panel has never been this easy!
