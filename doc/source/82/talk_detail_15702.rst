Demystifying Concurrency: debugging + performance strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Concurrent programming is one strategy to performance demands.  When is this reasonable?  When does this hit a wall, and how can you select an appropriate strategy when facing the need for speed, or when looking at existing concurrent code?  Define specifically the problem you’re observing, distill it to its essence.   Collect objective data to test your analysis and assumptions in getting to an essence.  Debug the performance issue in the essential instance, and validate.   Then, pick from the various strategies to address. We’ll walk through a specific case study.
