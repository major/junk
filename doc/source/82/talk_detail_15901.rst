Who touched my domain? it's time to move to Identity v3!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Identity API v3 has been available since the OpenStack Grizzly release. However, its adoption hasn’t been as widespread as we in the Keystone community expected. In Mitaka, we’ve decided to mark the API v2.0 as deprecated, signaling its removal in the next releases. In this talk, we’ll show the differences between Identity API v2.0 and v3;  introduce some of the various new features included in API v3, such as domains, federation, groups, hierarchical projects and inherited role assignments; we also intend to talk about the importance of authentication sessions. Finally, we will discuss the results gathered from a users and operators survey about the Identity v3 adoption.
