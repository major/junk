Continuous Packaging, the next step after CI and before CD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We are used to the concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and how they’re applied to our daily work on OpenStack. However, we tend to miss the importance of packaging, even though a large amount of the current OpenStack deployments are done using packages rather than source. Enter the world of Continuous Packaging, where every commit to your OpenStack project gets automatically packaged and tested.This allows for early detection of new dependencies and issues and enables Continuous Delivery, the packaging way.
