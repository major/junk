Behind the scenes of testing RDO, an open source community OpenStack distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack strives to provide APIs that abstract complex operations in order to mix and match different OpenStack projects, hardware, and network topologies. We verify that aspiration by testing an ever-growing matrix of possible combinations of installing and configuring OpenStack. This process is difficult and intensive. In this presentation, two engineers of the RDO community will share their experience testing trunk across these different installation scenarios. Join us to dive into the projects the RDO community uses to tackle this challenge, and learn how you can get involved.


* **David Moreau Simard** *(David is a Senior Software Engineer in the RDO engineering team at Red Hat where his efforts are around empowering the community to deliver a reliable OpenStack distribution. He brings his expertise around operations, infrastructure, tooling and CI to ensure RDO is the most stable OpenStack packaging distribution. Previously, he was at iWeb, a server and datacenter infrastructure provider where he held various technical and leadership roles in the span of nearly a decade. In the last years, his focus was around deploying and supporting a highly available multi-region OpenStack public cloud in different datacenters around the world.He holds a blog on https://dmsimard.com where he shares articles about what he learns and his interests.)*

* **John Trowbridge** *(John moved from a role supporting OpenStack to a role hacking on it, so he knows a little bit about a lot. Focusing on improving the new user experience of TripleO through the tripleo-quickstart[1] project. Also contributing heavily to the continuous delivery of OpenStack packages with the RDO project.
