Lightning Talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Share you knowledge with your fellow upstream developers! Lightning talks here can be anything from a neat feature your editor has which allows contributing to OpenStack easier. Maybe there is a lesser known OSLO library that you know would excite a wider audience. You could also have a neat documentation tool that would get the audience putting on their fancy socks!
