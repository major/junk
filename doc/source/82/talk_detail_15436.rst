Ironic Grenade: Blowing up our upgrades.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Come and learn about the Ironic teamâ€™s efforts in making upgrade testing (Grenade) work. We will be discussing all the various obstacles and pitfalls that we ran into in getting Grenade to work for the Ironic project. Most everyone agrees that cloud upgrades need to be smooth, quick and reliable, with no downtime for data or the control plane. During the active code development processes it is very easy to break upgradability even with small changes. By adding larger features it becomes more likely. Ironic has become an actively developed project and in every release there are many new features added to Ironic. The Ironic Community decided that automated testing of upgrades was the #1 priority for Newton cycle. In this session, we will tell about the basic concepts of the testing of upgrades at the gates with help of Grenade. We highlight the difficulties faced by the Ironic team. Finally we will list what's currently being worked on and we'll look at the rolling upgrades roadmap.
