YAQL: The query language inside Murano, Mistral, Heat, and Fuel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

YAQL — Yet Another Query Language has been around for several years. Initially created as a data manipulation language for Murano, it has since been employed by several other OpenStack projects. YAQL is currently used by Murano, Mistral, Heat, and Fuel. YAQL is an embeddable and extensible query language that enables you to manipulate and query arbitrarily complex data structures. It grants its users the powert to perform complex queries in a single line expression. In this presentation we’re going to cover: A brief history of how YAQL was developed An overview of YAQL’s capabilities How these OpenStack projects use YAQL to manipulate complex sets of data How you can embed YAQL into your project and extend it with project-specific fundtions Where YAQL itself is heading
