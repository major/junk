Switching to oslo.db EngineFacade in OpenStack projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

EngineFacade is a part of the oslo.db library, implemented in Kilo, which provides a simple way of declaratively defining session/transactional scope using function decorators or context managers. Despite many advantages, EngineFacade hasn’t yet been adopted by OpenStack projects except Ironic and Nova. We believe it should be. Attendees at this session will hear discussed: : Benefits of EngineFacade Challenges involved in switching OpenStack projects to use oslo.db EngineFacade How to switch: Examination of patches showing how Nova was switched to use EngineFacade They will leave with much-improved understanding of EngineFacade and ability to help their projects make the switch.
