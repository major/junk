Mutable config and you
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Mutable config is the ability to reload configuration (also logging configuration!) at runtime without a service restart. It is live in Nova Newton and I need your help to enable more projects and options. This talk will introduce the feature and walk through the patches required to take advantage of it in your project.
