The Gopenstack.org. rewrite. Crazy? Or just crazy enough to work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It was (correctly) decided that introducing Go as an acceptable language inOpenStack would cause community fragmentation.Monty Taylor eloquently stated:>If we want to add Go, or any other language, into the mix for server>projects, I think it should be done with the intent that we are going to>do it because it's a markedly better choice across the board, that we>are going to rewrite literally everythingCrazy right? Maybe not, let's talk about it for 45 minutes.This thought experiment will include discourse on:What could we fix? Bad architectures, data models, operations, scope, tooling, CLIs, and performance.What would it cost? Developer skill/training, new frameworks, money, time? What would (still) suck? Review time, docs, getting started, corporate interest. Can we ever fix these things?
