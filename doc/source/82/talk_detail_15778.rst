Firehose: A unified message bus for Infra services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Development of OpenStack operates at a tremendous scale, with hundreds of repositories and thousands of contributors interacting continuously. The community infrastructure to support this has to operate at an equally large scale to ensure that it is not outpaced by the volume of upstream activity. Accordingly, enabling anyone to see what is happening in real time in this increasingly complex infrastructure becomes equally complex and large. This is why we need to have interfaces available to develop tooling to handle this. During the Newton cycle we introduced firehose.openstack.org to provide a unified message bus. Built using MQTT and the Mosquitto broker, firehose is a consistent interface where Infra's services can publish events. This will go over the origin and background behind the unified message bus, how it's constructed and used by Infra, and also explain the benefits to the wider community and how they can use it for their own needs, experimentation and innovation.
