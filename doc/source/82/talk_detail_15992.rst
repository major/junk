Guerrilla TripleO for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While TripleO can seem impenetrable to anyone who does not regularly work with it, the tooling for getting up and running has improved immensely in the last year, and more and more developers are getting involved. However, given time, you will inevitably run into situations like: You have succeeded in setting up a virtual environment because you need to submit a patch, reproduce an issue or just want to try it out. But now you have to do it again for a previous release Everything is fine in a minimal setup, but now you need to add more controllers or compute instances to your setup You have two computers, and it would speed things up if you could spread your deployments across them Using the existing tools and starting-from-scratch may seem like a valid approach, but there may be a better way. In this session, we explore how you can: Take one virtual setup and turn it into many Add virtual nodes to existing deployments Add virtual nodes hosted on another server
