Making your service searchable in Horizon with Searchlight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack's Searchlight service uses ElasticSearch at its core to provide powerful, fast searching of cloud resources. Horizon now has a panel plugin that makes use of Searchlight to give you lightning-fast information about your cloud inventory. As a developer, several questions quickly emerge: How do I build plugins into Searchlight-UI for my service/component? What are the best practices for giving users a consistent interface? Do I have to rewrite my existing Horizon actions? To help answer these, we'll delve into the back-end, describing how services and third-parties can easily augment the interface provided. Although many of the UI elements are auto-generated by data retrieved from the Searchlight service, the UI may also be extended to provide maximum value to an end user. "Drawer" views in results and further detailed information may all be customized based on a simple, consolidated registration system available to both developers of core services and third-party plugins
