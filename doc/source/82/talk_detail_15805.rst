Your CLI user experience matter, OpenStackClient 101
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Love it or hate it, OpenStackClient (OSC) is here to stay. Dean and Steve have been working with OSC since it's infancy and are able to discuss it's history, current status and future better than anyone. We'll give an overview of OSC's plugin framework and mention which OpenStack projects have plugins (spoiler: it's a lot!). We'll give an overview of our UX standards and the minor, but elegant UX improvements OSC has over the traditional CLIs (better error messages, bulk actions, built-in formatters). We'll also show how to use the different keystone auth plugins (Time based password, using federated identity credentials, etc) that can be used with OpenStackClient.
