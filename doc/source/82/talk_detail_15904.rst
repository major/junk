A look into the future: A consistent OpenStack GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack operators spoke – we listened. The lack of consistency throughout GUIs frustrates people. Alex and Rodrigo will discuss the research, collaboration, time, and effort needed to create a set of patterns that are easy to follow and easy to implement; showcasing the importance of GUI conventions to drive consistency. Join us and provide your insights, needs, suggestions, and concerns regarding this effort to improve the experience for both users and developers alike. Currently, OpenStack projects with a GUI lack consistent guidelines. This session hits on that pain point and provides the developers with the opportunity to be part of the conversation, to ask questions about the plan, and to get involved in the solution.
