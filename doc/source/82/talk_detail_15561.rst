Shipping OpenStack Fast & Furious
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Shipping OpenStack in a consumable form is quite challenging. In this session, you’ll learn what happens behind the scenes from engineers responsible for two of the most popular distributions of OpenStack. We’ll show you how Debian and RDO manage to provide high-end grade distributions while delivering right after upstream general availability. In this talk, we'll present our workflow, and how we rely on Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery to meet upstream fast-paced deadlines.Also, how downstream collaborate together to make OpenStack a first-class citizens in their respective distros.

He is part of the CentOS Cloud SIG member, where he maintains CentOS packaging for OpenStack. He is the former PTL and current core contributor for the RPM packaging project He works at Red Hat in the RDO Engineering team as one of the driving force for OpenStack packaging.  )*

* **Thomas Goirand** *(Thomas Goirand has been packaging OpenStack in Debian since the Cactus release five years ago. Since, he has done most of the packaging of Python modules for OpenStack, which also end up in Ubuntu, and all the server packages. For the last year, Python modules have worked together with Canonical directly in Debian. Only the server packages are different in Debian and Ubuntu.)*
