OPNFV and OpenStack: how to leverage upstream testing tools?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OPNFV is an open source platform that uses OpenStack as the Virtual Infrastructure Layer to enable the integration of different upstream components. In OPNFV we don’t want to reinvent the wheel when it comes to testing and verification. For this reason, we try to leverage the upstream test frameworks to validate our platform from a functional point of view. This presentation will show what the upstream testing components are and how they are used and adapted to our needs.
