Who Slowed Down My Cheese?

**Abstract:**

We all know the value of finding bugs as close to their introduction as possible. The time to diagnose a problem is generally inversely proportional to the age of the code that introduced it and this applies doubly for performance bugs.  Performance bugs are notorious for showing up later in the development cycle since they often require a more sophisticated environment and more than just functional tests.  As a result, these kinds of bugs often are more difficult to diagnose, more time consuming, and more costly to fix.  This talk will discuss how we at the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) have crafted a continuous integration flow using standard performance tooling to help detect performance degradations earlier than ever before.  We’ll dive into how this work is important to OpenStack upstream developers through downstream vendors and discuss how the metrics we capture will prove beneficial in establishing confidence in the stability and performance of your OpenStack cloud.

Since Oct 2013, I've been working on QA projects for the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) as well as Barbican (key management for OpenStack) and find it challenging and interesting...but most of all enjoyable. Previously, I spent 25 years working for IBM Corp with roles that span the software development lifecycle - architecture, design, development, test, performance and consulting. Outside of work I enjoy ice hockey, photography, and Formula 1 racing.)*
