Tempest Testing with OpenStack Neutron LBaaS v2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud Load Balancers manages application traffic or workload fluctuations by distributing the weight across multiple servers and resources. So how can we be sure that a Load Balancer is working as it should? The speakers of the Neutron LBaaS test team will walk attendees through the Tempest tests for Neutron LBaaS V2 on a virtual machine running Devstack.  Attendees will leave with an understanding of how to use Tempest to test the API with a deep dive into tests scenarios and how to contribute to the Neutron-LBaaS V2 Tempest tests in the future!
