Agile Principles and OpenStack - Marriage Doomed to Fail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Agile Software Development has been the buzz on the market for quite a while. This talk will pick few of the most prominent principles from Agile Manifesto and use those to explain why agile methodologies are super unsuitable for OpenStack (or any similar large community opensource) development. Agile Principles are followed by multiple different implementations. This talk is not going to explain any of the implementations in depth nor it is going to list any pros or cons of the individual implementation. This talk is focusing purely to the issues that the principles of Agile Manifesto brings in at fundamental level. Obviously there is also things we can and should pick up from these Principles and lot to learn from the success of Agile Software Development, specially in the startup world. Perhaps the methologies would benefit most new projects that are just flowering within small groups.
