InfraCloud, a Community Cloud managed by the Project Infrastructure Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Infrastructure team, made up of contributors from multiple companies, runs the systems that support the development, testing, and hosting of OpenStack and the services that support the OpenStack community. With donated hardware and datacenter space, the team runs a private OpenStack cloud to support its automated software testing infrastructure. InfraCloud, the project born out of increasing demand from our growing developer community and a desire to "dogfood" OpenStack, is managed in the same manner as the rest of our infrastructure -- as open source, review-driven configuration. Though we've long been consumers of OpenStack clouds, running one ourselves poses new and exciting challenges. This session will discuss how we use cloud technologies to tame our hardware and how we leverage our open source infrastructure to run a cloud.
