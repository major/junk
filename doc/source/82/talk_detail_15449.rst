Improving code quality with Python Type Hints for fun and profit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Python type hints are a new feature in Python 3.5 which can help to improve code quality and readability, by adding information on what type parameters and return values can be. Type hints can be directly placed in Python 3.5 or higher code, or they can be placed in separate “type hint files” for all versions of Python. There are tools in the Python community that can perform static analysis of type hints in either the source code or in type hint files. This talk will go over our experience in adding type hints to an OpenStack project and performing static analysis on the project and what we learned. Did adding Python type hints improve the quality of the code? Come and find out about type hints and how they can improve your project.
