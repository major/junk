Software Defined Storage for MySQL on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Software defined storage (SDS), the abstraction of storage software from underlying hardware, has gained explosive adoption thanks to public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google. According to the latest user survey, MySQL is the most popular workload on OpenStack. Over the last two months, engineers at NetApp have been deploying OpenStack with a MySQL workload in a SDS platform with commodity hardware. Please join us to gain insights on deployment and validation of MySQL, architecture, and other deployment considerations for OpenStack with SDS. Though the deployment is done with OpenStack Manila (file share services), this presentation will be useful to those interested in using SDS for other workloads or in other ways (blocks, objects) with OpenStack, and taking advantage of enterprise storage features such as efficient snapshots, deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning, among others.
