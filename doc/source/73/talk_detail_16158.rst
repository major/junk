Architecting and Automating a Bcache Ceph Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Block storage is an integral part of any OpenStack deployment, and Ceph is one of the most popular options. However, Ceph can be expensive because of the number of disks required, especially when SSDs are chosen. Using Ceph with Bcache allows you to save money without sacrificing performance. In this talk we'll show you how we designed a Bcache Ceph cluster and automated its deployment with Ansible.
