Sheepdog: an alternative software-defined storage on your OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sheepdog is an open-source distributed storage system that can be integrated with OpenStack as Cinder/Glance backends. It is installed into commodity Linux servers to provide a scalable, reliable and manageable storage pool consisting of internal disk drives. It can run on not only dedicated servers but also Nova Compute ones so as to deploy hyper-converged infrastructure. With Sheepdog, you can launch your own cloud storage small then scale it out flexibly to fit your business growth. This talk will present how to use Sheepdog as Cinder/Glance backends, beginning with minimal installation then extending it. It will also cover recent topics in development and use cases. This introduction is good for attendees who find another way to build your own cloud storage.
