Sharing - what's true since childhood is true for clouds! Using Shared Filesystem in OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Efficient data storage is critical for large scale OpenStack cloud deployments. There are several shared file systems that can be used in an OpenStack cloud. These can be used to efficiently share data between Nova, Glance and Cinder, as well as provide storage for object and file based protocols with Swift and Manila. Enterprise features like copy on write file clones and file system snapshots, policy based tiering of data between storage classes, and intelligent backup schemes are important benefits that the filesystem backend can provide. In this presentation we describe these benefits that a shared file system can bring to your cloud architecture, as well as demonstrate an implementation based on Spectrum Scale.
