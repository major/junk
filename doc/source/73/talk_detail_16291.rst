Ceph Storage in PayPal Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation with focus on how Ceph is used to provide a low cost block storage alternative in PayPal Cloud. Existing block storage in PayPal Cloud was expensive and not applicable for several use cases. Hence, we decided to onboard Ceph block storage and integrate it with the existing OpenStack deployment in PayPal. Ceph block storage is integrated with cinder as a separate backend so that users/customers could continue to use block storage but have Ceph as an option in addition to the existing backend. This presentation will focus on the challenges encountered to enable Ceph in PayPal Cloud and the solutions adopted to overcome them. We will cover the following topics: 1) Ceph Deployment and Configuration 2) Ceph RBD and OpenStack Integration 3) Enabling Ceph as Cinder backend 4) Ceph Performance Evaluation 5) Monitoring Ceph Cluster
