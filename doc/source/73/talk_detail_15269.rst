Troubleshooting Ceph in the Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So you have a Ceph cluster that suddenly starts misbehaving, and want to get the cluster back to a healthy state as soon as possible. Sure, Ceph's health details will spit out a bunch of information: "some pgs are degraded", "a few operations are blocked", "oops, an OSD is down!". What can you do when the alarm bells start ringing? During this talk we'll walk you through the steps to be taken in various situations, from understanding some basic error messages, to setting the appropriate debug levels and looking for the right messages to fully understand what is wrong with your cluster.

Soon after finishing his MSc in Computer Science, Joao started working remotely for Inktank - a Los Angeles based startup focused on developing and providing enterprise support for Ceph. After a brief stay at Red Hat, Joao joined the SUSE storage team in early 2015, where he has been branching out from his comfort zone on the Ceph monitors to other components of Ceph.)*
