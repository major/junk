Swift3: The Use Cases and Features of Amazon S3 compatibility layer built on Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

 Highly dependable object storage is one of the key components to develop cloud application. Cloud application developers need to store any data for their application like media (picture/movie), their application logs, documents, and it could be also used as static HTTP content providers.  Amazon S3 is definitely an instance of de-fact standard object storage and OpenStack Swift is also used all over the world as the most common OSS object storage software.  In this talk, we would like to introduce Swift3 which is open source software to provide S3 compatibility built on top of OpenStack Swift and the customer success stories it has enabled.  This session covers with the topics:   - Overview of the Swift/S3/Swift3 protocol   - The similarities and fundamental differences between the Swift and S3 APIs   - Current compatibility with Swift3 & S3   - Customer feedback - what features are most important for customer?   - Community activities and future plans/priorities
