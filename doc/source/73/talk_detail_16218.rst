Ceph: The Next Generation at Comcast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Comcast’s journey with Ceph started 3 years ago with the release of Dumpling.  Since then, we have continued to evolve our ever-expanding Ceph footprint and, as a result, have many lessons learned and tips to share.  This presentation will discuss our next generation design from both a software and hardware point of view.  Topics Include: General hardware recommendations Ceph configuration tips, tricks, and advice Using cached block devices to improve performance Asynchronous active-active geo-replication using Rados Gateways
