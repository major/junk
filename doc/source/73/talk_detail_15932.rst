Keep your Data Lake Healthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A growing and aging data lake might fast become a polluted dump, plug up your pipes or might even overflow if not maintained. There is a growing demand for further object store management functions to keep the lake clean and healthy. For example to automatically compress and expire object data, as well as place data using an optimal storage tier, to allow access from file interface (SwiftOnfile), or save private data in an encrypted format. The session begins with a short overview of the swift storage policy mechanism and how it can be used to separate the object data stored in the underlying storage system. Further we will explain how combining the features of storage back ends with swift storage policies creates new functionality for your object store. This presentation includes examples and demonstrations. Keep your data lake clean and healthy. Add important data management functions to your object store, by (easily) attaching the needed storage policy and storage back end to it!
