CephFS - The Good, the bad and the ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Is CephFS ready for real world workloads after it's first 'production-ready' release?  We'd like to share eBay's experience on building file sharing service with OpenStack and Ceph: how we evaluate the performance of CephFS,  what CephFS's performance looks like comparing to alternative solutions and how we may productionize file sharing serivce with OpenStack.  We'd also dig into CephFS's caveats/limitations and share our thoughts on possible workarounds.
