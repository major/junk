Cinder storage benchmarking using vdbench and Heat orchestration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, I will describe using Heat orchestration to build a parameterized and scalable VdBench based system to run IO tests on cinder storage backends.  VdBench is a flexible Java-based IO generator written by Henk Vandenbergh of SUN microsystems and now Oracle.  VdBench can be configured to run in a master/slave configuration with all reporting through a central web repository.  This process can be used to compare drivers, configurations, resilience and performance of different storage platforms.
