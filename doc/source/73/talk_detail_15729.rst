CephFS & OpenStack Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In Austin, we discussed the release of a stable CephFS in Jewel, with several caveats around missing features and security in cloud environments. The CephFS team has been hard at work (and growing!) in the six months since. This talk will present an overview of CephFS, a POSIX filesystem built on top of the stable storage you already love and can manage from using RBD; and move on to the new work present in the latest “Kraken” release, especially as it relates to OpenStack and Manila users. Hear about how we’ve improved the security model and what our roadmap is for coveted features like arbitrary-subtree snapshots and horizontally-scalable metadata servers.
