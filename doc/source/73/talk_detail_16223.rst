Persistent resilient storage for containers in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The next phase in migration of workloads from virtualized environments to containers is when mission critical workloads start moving to containers. These workloads will have requirements like persistent storage, live migration, storage resiliency.In this session you will be introduced to an implementation of an OpenStack storage provider which delivers persistent resilient storage for container based workloads.
