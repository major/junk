Increasing Cloud's storage capacity to meet the dynamic growth demands of your tenants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The unceasing addition of new tenants and their growth's demands for storage requires frequent capacity expansion activities on the Cloud's storage infrastructure.  Meticulous efforts by a savvy staff with the precise expansion strategies are keys to successful deliveries of new storage in production environments.  My intention is to disseminate the practical experiences that were acquired through the deployments of new storage to production environments.  Adding storage capacity to the production sites without the tenants experiencing the service interruptions ensures a healthy tenant base.    A CEPH storage cluster is designed with the ability to increase the storage capacity dynamically.  CEPH gives us the ability to dynamically add the needed storage to an existing storage cluster to serve the new demands.
