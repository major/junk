Intelligent Archival Systems for Cognitive and Analytics Workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session discusses how the Ennovar Lab at Wichita State and IBM are combining emerging technology based on metadata search with OpenStack Swift object storage to create a next generation, cognitive and analytics enabled Intelligent Archival System.  The intelligent archival system integrates with custom metadata tag and search technology and Swift High Latency Media (SwiftHLM) middleware. It allows users to tag objects with application specific custom metadata and enables content aware migration of the objects to and from low cost storage pools such as tape or SMR drives based on the custom metadata. By placing the custom metadata on flash / SSD and making it readily accessible via REST API, cognitive applications as well as emerging analytics frameworks such as Spark can efficiently gain insight from the metadata while still achieving low cost due to the use of higher latency storage such as tape. A live demo of this capability will be included.
