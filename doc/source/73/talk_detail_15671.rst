OpenStack and Ceph: Block Storage Harmony
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceph is a fully open source distributed object store, network block device, and file system designed for reliability, performance, and scalability from terabytes to exabytes. The community has been very active integrating Ceph block storage into OpenStack, with deep support built into Nova, Cinder, and Glance. The most recent OpenStack user survey shows Ceph continues to be used in the majority of Cinder deployments. This session will explore the numerous capabilities integrated between Ceph RADOS block device (RBD) and OpenStack Nova, Cinder, and Glance services in addition to sharing the roadmap for future releases.
