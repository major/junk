Tips and Tricks for building an iSCSI deployment for Cinder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying the first few hosts is easy, but scaling your iSCSI Network for Cinder backends requires careful thought and planning. What are the considerations for deploying Cinder Backends using iSCSI drivers? How could this scale? What are the deployment considerations? What about the infamous Neutron network?  This talk will cover a host of issues when it comes to designing and deploying iSCSI backends with Cinder at scale for OpenStack Clouds.
