OpenStack Swift: Say hello to object storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Swift object storage is designed to scale on commodity or enterprise hardware. Swift enables data to be stored efficiently and cheaply. Accessing the stored data has become a major problem as everyone wants the data to be highly available across platforms and from their devices. Swift answers this need consistently and safely with Representational State Transfer (ReST) APIs.In this session, we’ll show that Swift is a long-term storage system with scalability, redundancy, and permanence. We’ll demonstrate how it stores data in an object form and how object replications work. We’ll also discuss Swift object versioning, which allows object/data archival. Its storage policies enable different storage implementations, like selecting different physical servers or disk as needed. In this presentation, you’ll see object versioning, access control, and storage policies in action.
