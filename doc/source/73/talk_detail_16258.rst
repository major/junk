Simplify your backup strategy using cloud storage with the Swift API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn why OpenStack Swift cloud storage presents new architectures for protecting your vital business data. Instead of backing up to storage silos, using 3rd-party replication tools, or even hauling tapes to the mountain and back, cloud storage enables near-unlimited scalability without reducing performance, automatic disaster recovery protection by geo-replicating data to other locations, and a cost-effective hardware infrastructure based on standard servers and high-capacity SATA disk drives.
