Adventures in exploring containers : Using, Cloudfuse to get Swift as Docker volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

During one of our explorations into containerized infrastructure challenges, we found that we needed a cheap solution to store terabytes of artifact. As an Openstack-certified provider, we're very keen on using Swift as the storage back-end for Artifactory, our artefact management system, but weren't satisfied with buying a $30k/ year driver for it. So we experimented with ways to configure and scale Cloudfuse, a Linux OS level driver for Swift. In this presentation, SÃ©bastien Delisle and Corentin Ardeois will share their journey into containers, artifact management, kernel security with docker, and a concrete Cloudfuse use-case.

Fast forward 25 years later, he's now a Javascript explorer, a pythonista and an OpenStack advocate. Currently involved with the OpenStack Javascript efforts and one of the technical lead of Internap, he is working on finding ways to make the OpenStack's and Internap's experience seamless.)*
