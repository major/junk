How do I move my elephants? Uncovering the mystery of Cinder and Manila Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cinder and Manila have proven to be effective providers of Block and File storage in OpenStack. Both projects have come a long way in providing a self service abstraction to a wide variety of storage systems and technologies that may exist in your data centers. Through the Newton release, there has been a great deal of focus in solving other important use cases such as high availability, data protection and disaster recovery which are critical in production environments. Through this session we will help you compare and navigate through the design and internals of the solutions that are available today. We will demonstrate how you can leverage the host level disaster recovery in cinder and tenant driven data replication in manila. We’ll discuss standard configuration best practices to benefit the use case/s you are trying to solve. We’ll take a sneak-peek at what’s in the works for the evolution of these features in the Ocata release and beyond.
