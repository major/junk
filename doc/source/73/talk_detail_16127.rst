Towards Zero ETL: Unifying data management across PaaS,CaaS and IaaS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Recent trends in application deployment point to hybrid deployment models cutting across PaaS, CaaS and IaaS runtimes.  A single deployment model cannot cater to all application types. Often enterprises need to deal with a mix of easily decomposable applications (12 factor micro services) and monolithic legacy applications. Common amongst them is need for data sharing and persistence. In this talk we will highlight the challenges in managing and enabling shared data access from across different runtimes such as Cloudfoundry, Docker and Openstack to common shared data.  We will share our experiences building data centric storage services for seamless data sharing using storage plugins for Docker, Cloudfoundry and Nova and highlight performance, resiliency and security implications of each of the alternatives and conclude with a common set of best practices.
