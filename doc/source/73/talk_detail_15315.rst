The Roadmap to Cohesive Data Protection in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data protection solutions differ from each other in many aspects: backup versus replication, on and off premise, hardware or software based, agent or agentless, cost, etc.  Furthermore, different resources in the organization have different requirements for data protection. OpenStack Smaug glues together OpenStack resources and data protection solutions (existing or new), and then provides a homogenous interface for a variety of protection plans, satisfying the most rigorous enterprise requirements.
