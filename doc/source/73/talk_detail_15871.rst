Second-level recovery of volume in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

     The topic involves the field of data protection in OpenStack. In order to meet the needs of recovery to the closest point after the disaster, we introduce the continuous data protection (CDP) technology in OpenStack. CDP is a technology which can continuously capture and save the changes of data to another independent location. Theoretically, it can recover to any specified point in the past. We apply the technology in OpenStack to provide second-level recovery of the disk in the virtual machine based on KVM. When a fault occurs, the disk can be recovered to the nearest time or any second.      In addition to describing the technology of second-level recovery of volume in OpenStack, this topic will provide a demo, demonstrating how to use and manage it.
