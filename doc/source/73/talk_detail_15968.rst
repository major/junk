New in Swift: Object Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the Newton cycle, Swift released an exciting new feature which enables encryption of object data at rest. OpenStack Swift provides reliable and scalable object storage that has been deployed in many successful production environments. With the Newton release Swift has added an exciting new feature to enable encryption of object data on disks. This feature is intended to protect data at rest from an attacker that gains physical access to disks. We will demonstrate this new feature, show how it is deployed, and discuss performance implications.
