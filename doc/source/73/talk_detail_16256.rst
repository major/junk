Ceph, now and later: our plan for open unified cloud storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceph is a highly scalable open source distributed storage system that provides object, block, and file interfaces on a single platform.  Although Ceph RBD block storage has dominated OpenStack deployments for several years, maturing object (S3, Swift, and librados) interfaces and stable CephFS (file) interfaces now make Ceph the only fully open source unified storage platform. This talk will cover Ceph's architectural vision and project mission and how our approach differs from alternative approaches to storage in the OpenStack ecosystem.  In particular, we will look at how our open development model dovetails well with OpenStack, how major contributors are advancing Ceph capabilities and performance at a rapid pace to adapt to new hardware types and deployment models, and what major features we are priotizing for the next few years to meet the needs of expanding cloud workloads.
