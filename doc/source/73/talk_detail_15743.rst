OpenStack’s Storage Performance:  Can you handle the truth?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Choosing the right storage for OpenStack is not a simple task.  Deciding what storage to use is a big problem in and of itself, but understanding how that storage performs, what its operational complexity really is, and what real workloads actually look like running on it are questions that anyone running OpenStack in production is faced with.
