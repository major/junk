Ready for Production - Swift3 - AWS S3 API on Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As more applications adopt Object Storage, it's important to cover all the bases. OpenStack Swift has a sister project, Swift3, that unlocks the S3 API on a Swift cluster. The Swift3 project has garnered much developer attention in the last year and is ready for production use cases. This session will detail the S3 features supported by the Swift3 project, recent improvements, benchmarks and upcoming enhancements, in addition to getting started with Swift3 on OpenStack Swift.
