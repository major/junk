Manila Share Groups - How, What, and Why
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Manila has developed "share groups", a generic grouping construct that, like individual shared filesystems, is an atomic data type.  Building on our experience with consistency groups in both Manila and Cinder, "share groups" provide a more consistent user experience, simplify management of cloud applications, and can serve a much broader set of use cases such as group-based replication, migration, cloning and backup.
