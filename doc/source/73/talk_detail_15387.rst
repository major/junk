Building a Highly Available OpenStack Storage Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data availability is just as important as data reliability.. if you cant get to it then you might as well not have it!  Deploying a storage solution for Cinder, Swift, Manila and even just standard user data with Openstack has to include a level of availability both from a single site perspective as well as a multi-site perspectives.  This session dives into options available for storage in from the block side with scale up options in single and multi-site solutions, scale out options for object storage as well as the backend storage needed for services like Manila.  The types of storage today will be detailed and where each type fits will be shown.
