For example, we will answer questions like: * how much time does it take to do an online upgrade of a 1 PB cluster? * how to deal with PG problems? * how to backup more than 1 PB of data? * how many objects can you store in a single RGW bucket and what happens when you put too much? * how big should your clusters be to reduce blast radius Come and listen to those and other stories!
