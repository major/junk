openATTIC: Managing Ceph and Storage with Linux and Open Source Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

openATTIC is a comprehensive open source storage management solution with a clean and intuitive web-based user interface.Under development for more than 5 years, it is based on a modern and extensible architecture built with proven web technologies and frameworks like Django, AngularJS and Bootstrap.It supports a wide range of storage technologies, both file- and block-based, e.g. NFS, CIFS, iSCSI and FibreChannel.In order to provide a scale out storage option, the development of Ceph management and monitoring support was begun in early 2015, now supporting a cluster status dashboard, options to manage and monitor Ceph pools, RBDs and OSDs.More functionality is planned and under development.All functionality is available via a web interface and RESTful APIs through a common backend.The development takes place in the open, with a strong focus on early community involvement.

He represents SUSE on the Ceph Advisory Board as a founding member, and is a frequent invited speaker. Since joining S.u.S.E. in March 2000, his previous roles include senior consultant, kernel engineer, engineering manager in SUSE Labs, and he is most known for his work on the Linux High-Availability stack and distributed systems engineering. He was named Distinguished Engineer in 2012. He holds an MSc from the University of Liverpool. He moved to Berlin in 2014. He wears black.)*

* **Kai Wagner** *(Im part of the openATTIC team. We´re building an Open Source Storage Solution for local storage and ceph management. Ceph is the first choice for OpenStack. That's one of the reasons why we're developing the ceph managemnt within openATTIC. Ceph should be trivial to everyone - specially for OpenStack users.)*
