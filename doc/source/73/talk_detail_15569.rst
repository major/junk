Cinder Next : Towards "Truly Software Defined Storage” Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cinder has come a long way and it now supports many storage systems, making it truly a vendor-independent storage controller. In other words no vendor lock-in. However, there is more work to be done for it to qualify as a “truly software defined storage controller”. In this talk, we will give insight into what things the Cinder project community should consider for the upcoming road map so that it can distinguish itself as the best SDS solution available. We will offer a candidate list of new features and capabilities such as storage discovery, performance based port selection, storage migration hardware support, etc. For each feature, we will delve on how they can be implemented, and why they are the features to be considered for Cinder roadmap.
