Building a solid storage foundation for traditional and new workloads in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today, it feels like the the IT world is going through changes faster than ever: the emergence of Third Platform, DevOps as a new way of working, or for example containers as a new way of running and deploying applications. However, at the same time, traditional workloads continue to exist and still need to be operated. This poses a challenge for IT departments, since they now have to manage new, as well as existing workloads. Short-term, it may be feasible to operate different platforms for each of these workloads, but mid-term, a consolidated platform based on OpenStack is obviously desired. In this session we will discuss how you can design a solid storage foundation for your OpenStack cloud, while not only accommodating traditional business applications, but also new workloads on the same platform. We will discuss the different types of data in cloud environments and provide recommendations for how to deploy and manage storage in a modern hybrid cloud datacenter.
