Breaking block storage performance limits: Introducing NVMe over fabrics integration with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NVM Express (NVMe) is a storage technology allowing to access Solid State Drives (SSD) directly over PCI. This allows for a much better throughput, latency and IO Operations Per Second (IOPS). NVMe over Fabrics (NVMf) is a new open source Linux project that provides access to NVMe devices over the network. This industry standards based technology enables sharing a pool of high-performance NVMe SSDs among multiple Nova instances running on a compute cluster. This talk presents the integration of NVMf volumes under Cinder framework, and how OpenStack users can benefit from high-performance NVMe SSDs. The session also presents early performance results and future areas of work for community participation.
