“Hello Smaug!” – An Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Smaug is a new OpenStack Big Tent project, which provides a set of APIs and an service framework for orchestrating data protection and restore functions.  It allows OpenStack users to use Cinder backup capabilities to meet business use cases, by creating protection plans that cover various resource types, such as volumes, virtual machines, networks, as well as extend to handle custom entities.  Its pluggable architecture enables 3rd party software vendors to integrate proprietary and commercial protection services to offer additional features to the user. In this session we will have an introductory tutorial about Smaug, explore its architecture and inner-workings, how it is deployed, and how it can work with other OpenStack projects, such as Cinder, Nova, Swift, Freezer and Manila.
