Go - Why and what of Swift is moving to Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Swift is large-scale storage, and it has been successfully deployed in thousands of places all over the world. We're constantly looking for ways to improve performance and efficiency in the system. At its most basic level, Swift brokers network requests and disk access. Since networks and hard drives work very differently, managing each of these so they are both used efficiently is a difficult technical problem. This talk will cover the various strategies the Swift community has used over the years to provide better performance for end users. We'll examine each in detail, including their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we'll conclude with a discussion on the current work that's being done to reimplement some parts of Swift in the Go programming language.
