OpenStack and Ceph @ Converged Microservers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

On the Austin Summit the Ceph Community and WDLabs presented about running a 4 Petabyte Ceph on ethernet attached Converged Microserver He8 drives. WDLabs provided access to early production devices for key customers for early adoption and feedback. This talk will provide insight into our experience with running a Ceph cluster on these devices as a storage provider for our OpenStack environment and will address among others topics like: How to deploy and manage a cluster where each drive is a server? Does the setup influence the network architecture of your cloud? What level of performance (native vs Ceph) can be expected? Are there implications on security and data privacy? What could come next?
