Distributed file access in OpenStack Swift - development update and live demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack developers have had all they need in the Swift API to build new applications and store unstructured data in Swift. But what about classic apps that are not yet refactored? And maybe there are requirements to read from or move data between Swift and NAS storage. At OpenStack Summit Austin, we introduced an architecture for adding distributed files capabilities to OpenStack Swift, which will be developed in a open project called ProxyFS. In this session, we will provide an update on development progress and demonstrate the current functionality.

He went on to co-found SwiftStack and serves as CEO. SwiftStack powers enterprises with a software defined storage platform, built on the OpenStack Swift object storage engine, to build a massively scalable private cloud.Prior to working with OpenStack, Joe was the Director of engineering at Cloudscaling, where he managed OpenStack deployments at KT and Internap. Joe also headed up engineering for Engine Yard, overseeing the development of their Ruby on Rails deployment platform, AppCloud and managing the open source efforts of Rails 3, JRuby and Rubinius.Joe is the author of OpenStack Swift, published by O'Reilly.)*
