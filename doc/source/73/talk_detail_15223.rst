Smaug - An ecosystem for Data Protection Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Smaug is a new OpenStack Big Tent project, focused on protecting the Data and Metadata that comprises an OpenStack-deployed Application against loss/damage (e.g. backup, replication) by providing a standard framework of APIs and services that allows vendors to provide plugins through a unified interface. In this talk, we will present Smaug's vision of an ecosystem for data protection providers, using Smaug to orchestrate backup and restore providers. We will also show how Smaug can be used inside a Disaster Recovery vendor's stack.
