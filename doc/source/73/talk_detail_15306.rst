Beyond Object Storage - A Unified storage Architecture for IoT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the immense growth of connected devices across multiple industry verticals in recent times, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms gained huge focus across various organisations. As volume, velocity of data generated by the IoT devices are massive, there exists a need for scalable, faster, analytic, internet friendly storage. Even though we are in early stages of IoT wave there exists multiple frameworks (centralized vs. decentalized), prototypes in market today. However with the maturity of IoT workloads, openstack swift architecture as a sole does not meet the growing requirements of IoT data. The proposed presentation discusses in detail various design issues and nuances associated with object storage serving IoT workload and presents different features, approaches to solve them by leveraging a massively scalable, parallel, n unified clustered file and object storage architecture.
