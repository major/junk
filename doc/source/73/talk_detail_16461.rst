The consequences of Infinite Storage Bandwith
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Overall increases in CPU and DRAM processing power are falling behind the massive acceleration in available storage and network bandwidth.  Storage management services are emerging as a serious bottleneck.  What does this imply for the datacenter of the future?  How will it affect the physical network and storage topologies?  And how will storage software need to change to meet these new realities?
