How to migrate a large Swift cluster to Erasure Coding?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Erasure Coding (EC) is full of promise. Do you want know how you could convert your clusters to EC without wasting months to download/upload your petabytes? Come to see how we did it. We will first quickly explain what is EC and how it works in Swift. We will then spend more time describing the migration process we designed, our choices about the method and how we made it scale to PB of data and billions of objects. We will also talk about the traps we fell into. This talk will also be the occasion to give a feedback on EC at scale, what you should and should not do when deploying EC in your clusters. Finally, we will see that with few improvements, this method can be reused for other needs.
