Swift at Scale: The IBM SoftLayer Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Come hear IBM SoftLayer's OpenStack Swift story and lessons from operating public object storage.IBM's SoftLayer began its OpenStack journey in early 2012 when it launched public OpenStack Swift clusters in three of its global datacenters. Over the last 4.5 years, it has added Swift clusters into 22 additional datacenters at break-neck pace, launched several multi-facility Swift clusters, and expanded global storage capacity by several orders of magnitude. Join us for this session as we share the story of our journey running Swift at scale over the years.
