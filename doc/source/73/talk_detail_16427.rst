Ceph BOF
~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot has been happening in the Ceph world, from the inclusion of CephFS with Jewel to ongoing work around the new Bluestore backend. This Ceph Birds of a Feather session will update Ceph users on the recent work in both Ceph development and the community while giving them the opportunity to ask questions of some of the core developers.  Prior to the session users will be able to populate an etherpad with questions and topics they would like addressed [http://pad.ceph.com/p/cephbofbarcelona] and other Ceph experts will be on hand to share their recent work and experiences as well.


* **Patrick McGarry** *(Patrick is currently incarnated as a Director of Community at Red Hat working to spread the Ceph gospel.  An experienced community manager, gamer, mischief maker, and all around geek, Patrick spent five years writing and managing Slashdot under the nomme du keyboard 'scuttlemonkey.'  Patrick enthusiastically helps companies to understand and adopt Open Source ideals and continues to be a strong advocate of FOSS on the desktop and in the enterprise.  He has strong feelings about tomatoes, longs for his deep, dark cave, and still hates writing these bios. )*

* **Sage Weil** *(Sage originally designed Ceph as part of his PhD research in Storage Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Since graduating, he has continued to refine the system with the goal of providing a stable next generation distributed storage system for Linux.)*
