Why you should consider using a cluster file system for OpenStack storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cluster file systems (shared-disk) provide concurrent access control for multiple clients. They can serve as an abstraction layer between compute and storage nodes. By using block based access protocol, cluster file systems provide high performance storage access compared to a network based distributed file systems. In this session, we will examine use cases for Docker containers, Nova instances, Manila file shared service and data migration. We will explain a best practice for deploying shared-disk file systems on OpenStack storage covering how the cluster file systems can provide concurrency, failover and access transparency. In addition an analysis of their performance characteristics will be presented.
