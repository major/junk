Protecting File Shares in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data protection is a vital requirement for any enterprise. No one likes to be caught off guard when the power goes out or the storage array goes off-line. Hence, choosing the right backup solution is critical in today's make-or-break economy. This is why Manila's storage backend replication capabilities are of critical importance! Not only do they allow OpenStack clouds to offer Shared File System based replication, but also enable users to achieve fail-over and fail-back. However, there are other potential solutions. We will discuss additional ways to achieve data protection for shared file systems, and explain how they work. We will demonstrate these alternatives, and try to fit them into use-cases that they are most suitable for:  Manila with a 3rd party backend driver Manila with Smaug and storage strategies Manila with Smaug and Swift Manila with Smaug, Swift, and Neutron (protecting both share data and share network) Freezer: The OpenStack Back-up as a Service Platform
