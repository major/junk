Block, Object, NFS, SMB in a single region storage cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You are asked to design and deploy an OpenStack private cloud. The requirements are straightforward: roughly 20-30 compute nodes, 100 cores and flat DHCP networking in a single region. However, you are expected to support a variety of storage protocols: block for database, object for images and videos, NFS and SMB for file shares. On top of that, service availability and reliability are critical. There are several architectural approaches to in designing a storage cluster, using Ceph, Swift, or unified block storage, but what are the pros and cons and what are the trade off's between performance, complexity, and costs between different between each of them?  In this session, we will explore multiple approaches and analyze the benefits, pitfalls and performance characteristics of each.
