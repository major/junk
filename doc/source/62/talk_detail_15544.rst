Choosing the right self paced OpenStack online training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It is becoming harder and harder to keep up with solid competence in fast evolving areas like OpenStack. At the same time it is in many cases hard to send administrators to a classroom course for weeks at a time. The solution can be self paced online trainings.  How do you choose the right one? I will share with my personal key findings from different self paces OpenStack Administration alternatives.  The alternatives we have tested: Red Hat OpenStack Administration online course CL210 OpenStack Administration Fundamentals (LFS252) Linux Academy OpenStack MCA100 - Associates Certification Following the Install guide on docs.openstack.org We will share our key findings and notable differences.

I am a really geeky dude that was forced to handle security and compliance so the only coding I do is on my spare time. Luckily that's also what I like to do in my spre time, work. But real work and not just a lot of complinace and regulations but something that is acctually for the betterment of mankind.  Unfortunately I happen to bee good at security, especially social engineering, and now I am stuck. But I am happy to share my knowledge and experience in making thins both secure and compliant. And no they are not alwas the same thing.  Compliance is solved through the cloud. Epecially smarter clouds. OpenStack is the key to this. OpenStack is 42 to compliance. One stack to forever in the darkness bind them.  )*
