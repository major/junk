Crowd sourcing OpenStack Operations - A walk through OpenStack Charms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Capturing and re-using OpenStack Operations best practises: introducing the OpenStack Charms project. Sadly operating an OpenStack cloud is still a challenge for many organisations. with basic tasks such as upgrading, expanding and enhancing requiring knowledge and experience. If we are able to capture operations best parctises in code and build community around it then we can help accelerate the proliferation of OpenStack. The OpenStack Charms project aims to do exactly this by providing operators and developers with a means of sharing operations best practises in code so that individual organisations are not having to learn as they go.
