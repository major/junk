Plethora of use cases with Openstack Storlets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Storlets enables to securely execute user-defined code near data residing in Openstack Swift. In this talk we introduce the project and demonstrate some real life use cases. Amongst the demonstrated use cases are: 1. Smart energy consumption services. Services, such as those offered by Gridpocket [1], rely on analytics over data collected from smart meters. Being highly sensitive data, storlets are used to preserve privacy by transforming the raw meters' data so that it can be made available to the energy analysis applications. 2.Efficient analytics over data in secondary storage. The amount of data (especially IoT data) being gathered for analytics is exponentially growing. Object storage is the typical choice for keeping such data sets. A critical question is whether these data sets, once there, can still be queried efficiently.With storlets we demonstrate up to X4 improvement when running SQL queries over CSV data kept in Openstack Swift.
