VMware NSX and Mirantis OpenStack integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will present Mirantis Fuel and its new Neutron plugin: VMware NSX. Is this a match made in heaven? Come to this session to see the integrations between MOS and NSX and see a live demo of the two in action.   Mirantis Fuel offers a robust OpenStack with ease of installation as well as ease of operation. It also offers a large number of validated plugins to enhance OpenStack on all areas (compute, operation, networking, storage, etc). VMware NSX provides advanced, rock-solid network virtualization for multi-hypervisor environments (obviously vCenter but also KVM!). It also offers unmatched network and security operation tools allowing OpenStack cloud admins to operate and troubleshoot OpenStack network and security services.

His expertise remains in the Network and Security space and so within OpenStack realm it's within the best OpenStack project: Neutron!)*
