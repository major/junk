How to build an OpenStack offering with out-of-tree drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many technical challenges and triumphs of building OpenStack with a non-x86 hypervisor.  This session will compare and contrast building an OpenStack solution on x86 vs on IBM z systems. We will focus our comparison on server deployment in Nova, network deployment in Neutron and performance monitoring in Ceilometer.  The session will answer the question if it is possible for SUSE and IBM to create an OpenStack solution for z/VM that allows the hypervisor to keep its unique value statements and whether the same architectural assumptions as on x86 are still valid.
