Automated path to Red Hat OpenStack Platform Certification? Yes, please.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A successful Openstack deployment is only possible if all layers of the system play well together, from the hardware all the way up to the cloud applications.All the components that make up OpenStack are thoroughly tested independently, but it is hard to know how they would end up behaving once put together.Red Hat provides a unique way for its partners to continuously test their setups with the latest snapshot of the Red Hat OpenStack Distribution.This approach has several benefits:  * Catch bugs as early as possible with a battery of tests.  * Extend the testing ecosystem beyond the Red Hat walls and into partner's environments.  * Make partners an integral part of the Red Hat OpenStack Distribution development cycle.  * Speed up the Red Hat OpenStack Certification process for partners.As a result of being part of this effort, if a partner has a passing CI when the engineering team decides to make the cut for the new release, their platform can be certified from day 1
