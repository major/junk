Unifying OpenStack and Public Clouds with Scalr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

User experience is a top priority, and embracing the Hybrid Cloud paradigm brings its own set of unique problems. Offering multiple backends is not a positive if it dumps the burden of relearning and recoding onto the same users that we’re trying to empower. At Symantec, we are leveraging Scalr to provide a uniform experience to our customers, regardless if they wish to use OpenStack, AWS, or any other cloud platform they feel would suit their needs best. Our solution provides : * Cross-region DNS Management – using a single Designate installation to manage all zones and records * Server Farm Management – assigning roles to VMs and managing a group as one * Integration with Keystone – Mapping Scalr accounts to Keystone tenants
