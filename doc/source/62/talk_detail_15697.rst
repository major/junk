Simplifying Hybrid Cloud with Heat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises are embracing hybrid cloud, and leveraging the power of OpenStack and the flexibility of Heat orchestration to automate the provisioning of their workloads. In this session, learn how IBM customers are solving this problem and bridging the gap between diverse cloud platforms with Heat orchestration and the IBM UrbanCode Deploy Blueprint Designer, featuring: - rich graphical editor to easily create a full stack HOT template (blueprint) comprised of both IaaS resources (compute, network, storage), and associated software deployments - seamless configuration of blueprints for portability across different cloud providers, including OpenStack, Microsoft Azure, VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), AWS, and others. - provision via Heat and leverage real-time results of deployments via a composite environment viewÂ
