How to support both public cloud and heterogeneous "backend resources" based on a newframework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Now openstack has the ability of managing private and other public cloud resources simultaneously with the help of the new framework we created. The framework offers the same interfaces with the core component of openstack, so the dashboard/CLI can do the same thing with private and public cloud, and even backup resources between clouds. Currently, one of our customers TCL is using the framework to manage his private resources and aws resources effectively, and another customer,the BGI, also used the framework to manage his private resources and aws,ali resources.
