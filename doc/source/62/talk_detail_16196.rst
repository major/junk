Sentinel: A Platform for Fine-grained Application Security on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sentinel provides a robust declarative model to express policies between applications, security zones, etc. The highly-scalable policy engine evaluates the policies and automatically enforces the rules on multiple types of endpoints, including OpenStack VMs, containers, legacy systems and vendor Firewall devices. The system continuously reacts to topology changes and seamlessly applies the rules on end-devices. The system also supports near real-time monitoring & visualization of the deployed policies. Sentinel is currently being used at web-scale within eBay to secure applications running across multiple OpenStack clusters and on legacy environments. The talk will be organized as follows. Brief overview of the cloud architecture at eBay Existing policy systems Sentinel Architecture & Policy Language Policy Evaluation & Enforcement Use of Kubernetes API & controller framework for declarative programming Monitoring & real-time visualization of policy violations Challenges
