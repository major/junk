Zero Admin OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Setting and operating OpenStack is hard and there are a few experts available on the market. With SolidFire and Platform9 it is possible to have a zero admin OpenStack. SolidFire is a storage which was built for OpenStack. It can be setup in Minutes without any expert skills and is fully managed by OpenStack. Platform9 introduces OpenStack as a SaaS offering. The entire OpenStack Control Plane is running in the cloud and is operated by Platform9. In the local datacenter a hostagent is installed on a plain Linux server. That hostagent talks to the Control plane and installs and runs all required modules like Nove, Cinder, Neutron, Glance locally on the servers in the onprem datacenter. With this approach it is possible to implement an entire OpenStack solution in the own datacenter without having Openstack skills. The Openstack environment is operated by Platform9 who are doing updates and support which eliminates the typical operational pain.
