Interoperability: The Promises vs. Reality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While there’s no promise of everything working perfectly, interoperability is a key component of the OpenStack ecosystem. Trove, the OpenStack Database as a Service (DBaaS) offering, runs on several different versions of OpenStack all while supporting relational and non-relational databases.  These databases, like Cassandra, Couchbase, and MySQL, for example, are all supported while the Tesora DBaaS Platform runs on Mitaka, Liberty, and Kilo. In this talk, we will address: Expectations for cross-operability when running the Tesora DBaaS platform. Lessoned learned when deploying Tesora DBaaS platform in a mixed-version OpenStack environment. Challenges associated with qualifying an increasingly complex test matrix. Attendees will take away practical, realistic advice for addressing obstacles when working in an environment with cross-operability.
