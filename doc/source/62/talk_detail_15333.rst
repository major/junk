What did we learn: The road of productize OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

More vendors starts to build commercial products based on OpenStack community releases, which is very good for OpenStack society. But it is not as easy as it sounds, in order to build commercial products on top of OpenStack, considering continues evolution, one should got involved deeply to the community, and thinking carefully about the product planning strategy, R&D process, HR structure and product release pace. Nevertheless, how to effectively synchronize OpenStack upstream and downstream product development, how to overcome the gap for QoS and sercurity standards between upstream and commercial products and how to fulfil customers requests that are ahead of OpenStack community's ability are also what vendors should care about. In this session, we will ilustrate the problems we meet in our way of building products based on OpenStack, share the lesson we learned and what we did to overcome them. Moreover, we will share the ideas and thinkings during our R&D process evolution.
