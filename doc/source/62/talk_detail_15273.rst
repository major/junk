Getting to Scalable Networking with Red Hat OpenStack and Juniper Contrail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With multiple complex networking options out there, Red Hat and Juniper have partnered to simplify the deployment of software-defined networking (SDN) for OpenStack. Join us to hear about our efforts deploying Contrail, what the future holds for Red Hat’s OpenStack Platform director-based SDN deployments, and current successes in the field. We will talk about: Current SDN deployment challenges in OpenStack What Red Hat and Juniper have done to improve this today The future of composability and what that means for director deployments Lessons learned from deployments in the field Benefits of a combined continuous integration infrastructure
