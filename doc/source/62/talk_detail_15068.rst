SEN - A Modular and Extensible Cloud Scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SEN is a general purpose open source cloud scheduler project. It tracks CPU, memory and other resources to determine scheduling policy. It has extensible architecture with two main goals: to support various cloud computing solutions on the market including OpenStack, and to allow addition of new scheduling algorithms and configuring the current ones. SEN comes with 2 virtual machine/volume placement algorithms to be readily used, namely RoundRobin and BestFitDecreasing which particularly aims energy efficiency on the cluster. Machine learning based VM placement algorithms are also being studied by SEN team. SEN takes account of affinity definitions, CPU models, and migration cost of the new VM placement while calculating the algorithm. SEN core and its OpenStack adapters are implemented and ready to be used. It is tested with various CPU, memory loads, flavors and heterogeneous CPU architectures on Mitaka and Liberty. Energy consumption is measured using hardware energy logger device.
