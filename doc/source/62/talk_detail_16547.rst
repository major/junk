Horizon UI Modifications in the Context of Short-lived, Complex, Interactive, Network centric Stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Riverbed is an enterprise networking company using OpenStack to replace a 6,000 physical machine lab. Our primary users are several hundred QA engineers who are often unfamiliar with OpenStack. This talk covers some relatively minor but high value changes made to Horizon in order to consistently display detailed network information, rapidly prototype network topologies, and lower the barrier of entry to writing HEAT Templates. Changes include deterministic display of the Curvature plugin, an interactive visual orchestration tool for applications on OpenStack, with drag and lock, a simplified VM launch bar, custom icons, multi level label information, and a button to dump hand-built topology to a rough Heat template.
