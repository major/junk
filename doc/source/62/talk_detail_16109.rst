Next Generation Mgmt for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A prototype for a next generation config management tool, and the specific problems this design solves. Three of the main design features of the tool include:* Parallel execution* Event driven mechanism* Distributed architectureThis talk will demo a prototype I've built that implements these ideas. It is written in golang, and is completely free software. It will feature working code and a number of live demos!We will discuss how this tool will make it much easier to solve the OpenStack management problem, and how it can be elegantly integrated in an existing software project like OpenStack.An introductory blog post on the subject is available. https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/ Attendees are encouraged to read it before the talk if they are interested!
