Shift from Naive to Cloud Native: Integrating OpenShift and Kubernetes with OpenStack Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenShift, Red Hat’s Kubernetes-based Container Platform, can be deployed easily and ‘naively’ on top of OpenStack. You can simply run the OpenShift Ansible playbooks & have OpenShift up and running on OpenStack. However you will not be taking full advantage of ‘native’ OpenStack Resources such as Heat, Cinder, Swift, LBaaS, Designate, Neutron & more. If you are going to run OpenShift in production at scale, you’ll want to integrate more tightly with native OpenStack resources. In this deep dive technical session, we’ll demonstrate how to move from a simple overlay installation to a dynamic fully integrated deployment which makes the best possible use of OpenStack services. After this session, you will have learned practical deployment patterns based on Red Hat’s reference architecture for OpenShift on OpenStack. This will enable you to configure OpenShift on your OpenStack production infrastructure to meet and scale all your organization’s container-based needs.
