Application/Intent Defined Storage in the Modern Storage World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Datera's "Application/Intent-centric" storage model brings operationalflexibility to the realm of storage administration. Volume-centric modelscan have difficulty scaling to the needs of the modern operator. In thispresentation we discuss the way Datera has fundamentally changed the way thatstorage is controlled. * Current state of Volume-centric storage* Intent defined storage* API First approach* Infrastructure awareness (Infrastructure as Code)* Economic Elasticity* Ease of Use
