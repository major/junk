Application Aware Root Cause Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Is application-aware RCA attainable? With the holistic system view of Vitrage you can drive application management using insights into application level faults.  Fault management in cloud systems is complex. With a mix of virtual & physical resources interacting, problems at one layer can have ripple effects throughout the system. One situation where this is most apparent is that of fault management in the context of app involvement.  Applications are comprised of virtual resources that may be distributed across separate OpenStack clusters, allowing for failures in one cluster to impact the performance of the other. This impact can be challenging to track in large production deployments. In this talk we present how Vitrage uses its latest Heat data source to give insights into application-level faults, and how Vitrage provides a clear and holistic view of the system, from physical infrastructure to virtual application, which can then be used to drive application management policy.
