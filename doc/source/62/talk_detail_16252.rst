CloudController® provides no-nonsense cloud automation for OpenStack resources along with other virtualized on-premise resources and public cloud services with a single workflow engine and a unified Service Catalog Manager. CloudController® also facilitates the integration of technical and business operations with the ability to create unlimited multi-tier service supply chains, customization of financial back office, contract lifecycle management, white-labeling, language and localization options at each level.
