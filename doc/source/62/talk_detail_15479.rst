OpenStack Keystone and Cloud Foundry UAA Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud Foundry (leading PaaS software) manages identity and access management with its User Account and Authentication (UAA) service; OpenStack has its identity service Keystone. The challenge is that integrating the two independent services to work together. Keystone has concepts such as projects (tenants) and domains; Cloud Foundry has concepts such as organizations and spaces. IBM Bluemix is based on Cloud Foundry. It’s a natural requirement for OpenStack Keystone to support UAA authentication. During the talk we will discuss how IBM’s Bluemix integrates both Cloud Foundry and OpenStack for a single user experience. We will present our current solution, its limitations, and our new solution that will be rolled out at a later date.The code for this will be almost completed before the summit and will be verified in our team project. The code will be also open sourced later and maintained by us.
