**Abstract:**

Unified Compute Platform(UCP) from Hitachi Data Systems is a leading converged infrastructure supporting broad range of enterprise workloads and use cases. With the growing interest, and popular acceptance of OpenStack there has been an increased customer demand to have OpenStack platform validated on UCP, and be made available for Enterprise private cloud, as well as other OpenStack based IaaS cloud deployments. Hitachi Data Systems, Brocade, and Red Hat have developed a validated solution, (UCP)2000 with Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0. This solution enables customers to quickly and reliably deploy OpenStack based private and hybrid cloud on converged infrastructure. The solution architecture is built on HDS 2u4n Server for Solution, Brocade 6740 NOS switches, and HDS G400 storage arrays. In addition to that, it includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.2, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform installer.
