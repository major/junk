Managing Containers and Clouds with ManageIQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers are becoming the standard delivery method for modern applications. Managing them next or on top of existing Infrastructure as a Service or traditional Virtual Environments require new tools which provide automatic relationship discovery, insight into Virtual Machines or Containerized Applications, and powerful reporting features, from one unified web interface. ManageIQ (www.manageiq.org) allows operators, developers and decision makers to retrieve the information they need, and also provide the management capabilities to support their daily tasks. This presentation will give an overview of ManageIQ, how it can manage multiple Container, Cloud and VIrtualization Providers and some examples how it can be integrated into small to large enterprise organizations.
