SurCloud: Killer Product to Win in OpenStack Ecosystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Compared with VMware, OpenStack is open, low-priced, but still not easy to use from the point of view of end user. SurCloud OpenStack all-in-one appliance pre-loads, pre-tests and pre-configures all software and hardware in a half rack. Zero deployment, plug & play without worrying about the complexity of OpenStack. SurCloud developed an unique technology called SurFS that significantly improves the traditional design of Distributed FS such as Ceph & Gluster FS, resulting extremely short I/O path, high bandwidth, low latency, high density and very low cost. SurCloud optimizes hardware and software together resulting in a perfect appliance which offers extreme performance, high availablity, highest data duarability, highest density, good user experience and good scalability at very low total costs of ownership.
