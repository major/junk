How to Integrate Aspera, F5 with Openstack as an High-Speed data transfer Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In order to let OpenStack Cloud be more out-of-box matching industry requirement, more useful feature to OpenStack Cloud as OpenStack Industry Solution is necessary. High-Speed data transfer is a common painpoint in cloud era, especially for media industries' new trend of 4K video,  TB/PB data from customer to cloud for big data analysis, etc. Aspera is an IBM software with high-speed data transfer patent FASP, which speed up 10x, 100x, 1000x in WAN under different network conditions. F5 is a famous load balance software, which have been integrated with Neutron LBaaS. In our solution,  Aspera as a cluster service is deployed in OpenStack VMs with autoscaling feature, and F5 as Neutron LBaaS provider, which provide an OpenStack Cloud with elastic high-speed data transfer capability. Our practice of how to realize this solution will be covered in this session.
