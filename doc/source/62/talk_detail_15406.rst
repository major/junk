Policy Driven Red Hat OpenStack Platform with Cisco ACI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is a comprehensive policy-based architecture that provides an intelligent, controller-based network switching fabric. ACI fabric is designed to be programmatically managed through an API interface that can be directly integrated into multiple orchestration, automation, and management tools, including OpenStack. In this session, audience will learn how integrating ACI with OpenStack allows dynamic creation of networking constructs to be driven directly from OpenStack requirements, while providing additional visibility within the ACI Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) down to the level of the individual VM instance.
