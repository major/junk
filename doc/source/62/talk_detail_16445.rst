The OpenStack Innovation Center - Working for You
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Since the inception of the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) a year ago, we’ve been working to make OpenStack easier for enterprise users. Learn about the progress we’ve made by training the next generation of OpenStack core developers who are helping alleviate some key bottlenecks to OpenStack’s rapid innovation. Hear about the community members who’ve taken advantage of our thousand node developer cloud. See the upstream work we’ve been doing to rectify the pain points and barriers we’ve heard from the OpenStack Foundation’s User Survey and beyond. After hearing all of that, we’ll dive into how you can participate, influence and learn directly from our work.
