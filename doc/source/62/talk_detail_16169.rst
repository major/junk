Deploy OpenStack and DevOps environments for multiple distributions on any cloud VM.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  We have created the ability to run OpenStack Mitaka on top of a Host OS (openSUSE Leap / SUSE SLE with the libvirt, QEMU and KVM) on all nodes of a local Server Cluster (100+ x86 CPUs, 300+ GB RAM, 4+ TB Disk Space) with a few clicks of the mouse. We can put our complete server cluster into the OpenStack deployment as compute nodes. We will then demonstrate how we can access the images from the CCPB (OLM) image repository server in the OpenStack deployment and also access them via the OpenStack Image service.  With the ability to setup VLAN routers with OpenStack, the nodes can access each other, and you can login to them via ssh, the Internet, our Software Factory/Application Marketplace and access the OpenStack VMs. We will also show you how we use the OpenStack Dashboard and OpenStack command line tool to perform operations on the OpenStack deployment
