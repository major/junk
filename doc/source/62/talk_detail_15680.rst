OpenStack and NFVi Real-World Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How to leverage latest OpenStack for ‘Virtual Ethernet Service Assurance and vCPE/vPE VNFs’ over converged infrastructure platforms. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) – and Software Defined Networking (SDN), for that matter – is all the rage but most CSPs are still slow to get it from proof of concept to an actual ubiquitous presence on the market. At the crux of NFV infrastructure is OpenStack, which brings all the capabilities and flexibility to achieve the various requirements expected by telcos and cloud service providers. This breakout session will cover how Kontron has worked with ISV partners – including one in particular for virtual Ethernet Service Assurance – to develop the NFVi solutions that help meet these particular CSP requirements with an eye on how OpenStack is an instrumental open source component.
