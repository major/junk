Remove job execution with Arc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Arc is a secure, multi-tenant job execution service for managing instances in an OpenStack environment. The service provides an API for scheduling jobs on remote instances and is designed to work in NATed network scenarios where targets are not accessible directly. Arc features an auto-updating remote agent that is easy to bootstrap and ships as a self-contained static binary for Windows and Linux. The remote agent contains an extensible fact discovery system that is used to build up a searchable inventory of instance metadata.   In this talk we will introduce Arc and show how it is used in SAP’s self-service cloud to build a higher level automation system for orchestrating application deployments. All components of the service will be released as open source.
