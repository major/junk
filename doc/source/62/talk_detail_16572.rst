~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The SurCloud OpenStack Appliance is an all-in-one, ready-for-production cloud data center in a half rack designed for extreme performance, HA, highest data durability, good scalability and inexpensive price. SurCloud Appliance leverages latest hardware technology (such as dual-port NVMe SSD), optimized architecture (e.g. an extremely short I/O path) and optimized software to enable the best performance of hardware (2M+ IOPS, few microseconds latency). SurCloud Appliance totally eliminates single points of failure by 100% redundancy design. This design plus automatically fail-over for all modules & services guarantees high availability. SurCloud Appliance leverages ZFS RAID-Z3 to reach 99.999999999% data durability at lowest cost. SurCloud Appliance optimizes configuration of both hardware and software to ensure no single dollar is wasted. The standard configuration which is good for a couple of thousands VMs is less than $300K. It also reserves enough space for future scale-out.
