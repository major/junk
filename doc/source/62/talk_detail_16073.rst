Hybrid hypervisors under VMware VIO and NSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO), which was launched in 2015, provides an easy and fast path to build OpenStack cloud on top of vSphere, NSX and Virtual SAN. VIO has been adopted by many customers like Nike. And most of existing and potential VIO users hope it can support both VMware and KVM hypervisors. In the past, it could not, because Neutron NSXv/DVS driver was tightly tied with vSphere. After VMware NSX Transformer, the next generation of NSX, comes into the world, VIO will be able to manage hybrid hypervisors (VMware+KVM) ! In this session we will introduce technical details of VIO managed hybrid hypervisors with NSX Transformer. This session covers: - The concept of VIO managed hybrid hypervisors (VMware+KVM). - The NSXv3 SDN for hybrid hypervisors - Technical details about VIO configuration of Nova, Neutron and Cinder. - Demo Attendees will learn the concept and detail of VIO managed hybrid hypervisors, NSX Transformer, including common features and differentiations.
