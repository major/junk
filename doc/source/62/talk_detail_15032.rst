Identity-as-a-Service for Cisco Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Identity management is one of the primary challenges when developing next generation Cloud Native applications and services. These services span across clouds, PaaS layers, and can be entrenched deeply in private Cloud deployments. These disparate platforms can each have unique policy, governance, and identity management systems. Cisco Cloud Services has been developing a next generation Identity as a Service (IDaaS) offering poised to change the way developers can manage identity across disparate platforms while being powerful, open and flexible. In this session you will learn about the architecture, functionality and capabilities of this new IDaaS offering. You will also learn how the IDaaS APIs can be used to incorporate identity management into your Docker Container apps, traditional services, and innovations.
