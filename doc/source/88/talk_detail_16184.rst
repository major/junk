Using Kibana & ElasticSearch with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation will provide an overview of Kibana and ElasticSearch. We will cover how they can be used in a distributed system and integrated with OpenStack. We will go into detail on how ElasticSearch shards logs and applies algorithm for search. We will demonstrate the capabilities of the Kibana user interface - searching logs, trending issues, exporting log files and more. Finally, we will provide examples of cases where Kibana was used to analyze and solve real world issues in OpenStack.
