The Gentle Breeze - Functional Testing in Neutron with Zephyr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides the Tempest testing framework to test OpenStack feature functionality.  However, it can be too high-level to test and debug Neutron as a standalone service. Zephyr is an open source framework for developers to test neutron as a standalone entity. Zephyr makes it easy for Neutron developers to test against the Neutron API.  Zephyr is also designed to allow extensible support for Neutron plugins, streamlining Neutron API compatibility testing for third-party Neutron plugin developers. This session will introduce the Zephyr project and design principles, and then we will show a Zephyr running on example test cases, and finally we will create a simple test in Zephyr and show the test results during the session.
