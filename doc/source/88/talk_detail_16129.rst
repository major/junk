Master to Metal with OpenStack Charms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How do specific OpenStack commit levels stack up in the metal rack?  In this talk we will discuss the use of OpenStack Charms to deploy OpenStack from source to bare metal, and why that is useful.  Developers and users alike can use the same set of OpenStack Charms to deploy and manage long-running production-grade clouds from stable cloud archive packages as well as dev, test and staging clouds directly from upstream project source code. Packaging can be tricky.  Repackaging from master can be a significant hurdle for a dev or operator to overcome in order to deploy trunk/master onto metal.  The OpenStack Charms enable devs and operators to leap that hurdle without having to repackage from trunk, as a valuable tool for evaluation and development.
