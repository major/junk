In Search of Immortality: Mastering the OpenStack Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Work Smarter, not Harder. We've heard this, but often don't have time to take a step back and figure out how to do it. This talk will explain many of the Developer tools that OpenStack has to offer, both within the OpenStack Infrastructure and using other Open Source technologies. We'll demo some tools, provide some tips, and share some community secrets with the goal of learning how to get more work done and tame complexity.OpenStack Developers and Operators might use tools like Git, Gerrit, and Tempest every day without maximizing the productivity from these technologies. Many engineers get into workflow habits and don't have time to re-tool or delve deeper. But there are always new features to explore and new ideas to implement in order to get more out of our precious time. Join Scott and Andrea as they explore and explain some of the ways to be more efficient in the OpenStack Developement environment.
