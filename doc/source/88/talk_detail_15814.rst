AT&T’s Agile Journey: OpenStack Platform Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In early 2014, AT&T had a multiple teams working on OpenStack development. As a result there were inconsistent and unaligned delivery processes. Since then AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) has iteratively implemented advanced Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices enabling Agile development teams to actively develop features, integrate new technologies, fail fast, and frequently deliver releases. Our journey has included rapid adoption of community build and coding standards. Behind the scenes implementation of Continuous Delivery using Fuel to provide AIC Verification Testing (AVT). Deep dark tales of early integration of Fuel 9.0 with OpenStack Kilo in order to accomplish a massive upgrade from a heavily customized Fuel 6.1.
