Storlets deep dive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack storlets is an emerging Openstack project that enables to execute user defined code in an isolated and secured manner within the storage nodes of Openstack Swift.In this talk we first introduce the architecture of the project and overview its functionality. We also describe how to write, deploy and invoke a storlet which is the actual code running near the data. Then, we give the latest status of the project, describing selected features and improvements done since the project was opened as an Openstack project by IBM. Finally, we describe the planned roadmap for the next release.


* **Eran Rom** *(Eran is an open source enthusiatic, who leads the Openstack storlets project and contributor to Openstack Swift. After 10 years in IBM research in the area of storage and systems, and with substantial experiance in leading research and development projects, many of them in the field of cloud storage, Eran has left the company to devote more time to the real thing: open source development.)*

* **Takashi Kajinami** *(Takashi Kajinami is a platform engineer at NTT DATA since 2012. He is working on the private cloud storage construction, with OpenStack Swift and Sheepdog. Recently we deals with IoT system and engaged in the software deployment of IoT services. He is now interested in OpenStack Storlets to realize an effective IoT system, and working as a contributor to that project. He also joined to Docker project to realize auto operation of IT system using Docker.)*

* **Kota Tsuyuzaki** *(Kota is a Software Engineer at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). NTT is one of the biggest telecommunication companies which provide cloud services in Japan. Kota has worked on OpenStack Swift for approximately 4 years. Recently, he has worked on global distributed cluster efficiency and the area of erasure code stuff in the Swift community and he has joined Swift core team since Jun 2015. Since before joining Swift core team, he is working on Swift3 as an upstream contributer and now take a role of PTL on the Swift3 project.)*
