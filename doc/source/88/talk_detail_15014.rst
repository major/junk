AIOrchestra. AsyncIO-based open source TOSCA orchestration framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OASIS TOSCA gains more and more involvement into cloud orchestration no matter what it is. OpenStack is not an exception: Murano accepts TOSCA through its plugins Tacker uses to describe NFV deployment topology Heat-translator (TOSCA to HOT) toscaparses library lived under OpenStack "Big Tent" So, as it can be seen, TOSCA is more than just yet another way to describe deployments, it is future for orchestration itself. But TOSCA is just a DSL to describe topology. AIOrchestra is an engine to process TOSCA DSL to real deployment process. By use of modern python 3.5 technologies like coroutines with async/await syntax AIOrchestra allows DevOps/Developers to write TOSCA templates to describe how they want to see their apps in clouds and the way how it would get into cloud. AIOrchestra is not a just a product driven by specific organisation, it is the way to reconsider the way we develop and deploy. The idea that stands behind it - open platform, open capabilities, open TOSCA.
