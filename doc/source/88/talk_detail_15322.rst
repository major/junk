Automating your manual test suite using a Tempest plugin, Scenario tests and Rally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Testing an OpenStack deployment by running 100s of detailed manual test scripts is a very time consuming effort. Â Luckily, the Tempest test framework has a plugin interface and scenario test framework that can be leveraged for automating detailed test scenarios. In addition to standard scenario test, that drive the OpenStack REST APIs, it is also possible to create scenario tests utilizing the WebDriver API for simulating browser interaction with Horizon, for full end-to-end UI test scenarios. Furthermore, a Tempest plugin can be installed into a Rally deployment, so you can leverage the power of Rally for persisting your test runs , as well as create reports and compare test runs etc. This presentation will outline and demonstrate the entire process for automating a single detailed test scenario.
