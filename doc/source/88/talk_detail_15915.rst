Drag and drop tool of Heat to help simplify creating stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Currently use heat to create stacks you have to manually write template files which have limited rules on syntax and format. Users spent much time on learning heat templates and tried to debug times to generate valid templates. This drag and drop tool is integrated into stacks panel page in Horizon. With the tool to create stack, what you need are: drag resource images, input required properties of resources and indicate relationships among resources. The tool will validate your inputs on each step and finally generate valid templates that you could use to create stacks. It greatly simplify creating heat stacks.
