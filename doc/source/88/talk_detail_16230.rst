Helping OpenStack adoption with an OCCI API Playground (and other OCCIware goodness)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

API adoption is a challenge for OpenStack's rich and complex APIs - a challenge that the OpenStack API Working Group has taken on in strides. In this talk, we will look at a way of helping API adoption, but we'll go beyond API documentation and technical playgrounds such as Swagger. We want to make the case for an interactive online tooling that takes advantage of REST discoverability. In a word, we introduce a REPL shell for REST APIs. We'll showcase a generic playground developed (as part of the OCCIware open source platform) for the OGF's Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), a generic API supported by OpenStack. We'll demonstrate how a beginner OpenStack OCCI API user can execute live examples in seconds, browse through REST resources (such as VMs), and easily generate and derive all kind of queries or changes. We'll finally show how this playground, as well as OCCI standard and OCCIware platform, is a solution to manage other layers and domains in the overall cloud stack.
