HOT for Heat: Validating your Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Need a way to test your actual stack deployment? Test networking, user permissions, storage access, security and more using HOT. HOT - Heat Orchestration Test is a framework that automates the validation of a deployment. HOT supports template yaml syntax checking, stack build success verification and a highly-flexible fabric-based testing to test the resulting servers. HOT has the ability to run tests from inside your resources and also from outside your environment. Fabric based tests use envassert and any other methods possible in a python script, this sshâ€™s onto your resource and runs tests. You can check firewall rules, running processes, ensure ports are open, files exist, etc. Script tests are used for testing from outside the environment. Examples include running selenium tests from your CI server, verifying service availability from outside the environment, or calling third party services to run tests such as vulnerability assessment or performance testing.
