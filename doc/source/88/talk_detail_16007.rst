OpenStack CI/CD for Everyone Else
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As a company that develops software on OpenStack, wouldn’t it be amazing if you could use the same robust continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) process that enables thousands of distributed developers to create reliable software at a blazing pace?  What if setting up this kind of system had an “Easy” button?  Well, the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) QA/CI team is here to help. We’ll walk through a series of best practices and lessons learned from setting up a CI/CD system using open-sourced tools. Your team will be able to leverage the same proven development process used by OpenStack developers upstream.  After this talk you’ll be able to increase your development team’s time-to-market,  efficiency and reliability, and you don't have to be a sysadmin or an IT manager to do it!
