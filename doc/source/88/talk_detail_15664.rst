Speeding up Developer Productivity with OpenStack and Open Source Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack’s orchestration service and APIs enable developers to easily deploy application infrastructure themselves…but what if developers want to use the popular open source tools with which they're already familiar? This talk covers how developers can use tools from HashiCorp (Vagrant, Terraform, Packer), Docker, Ansible, Puppet, and others to quickly provision workloads on OpenStack clouds. The presenters will share practical examples that attendees can follow along with at the talk and/or take back home to try in their own labs.
