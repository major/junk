Fresh, free hardware for testing: How we used OSIC to test OpenStack on  66 nodes for no charge.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A session on OpenStack provisioning and deployment starting from scratch across 66 nodes. This presentation will walk through the experience of using a 66 node bare-metal cluster from the OSIC (OpenStack Innovation Center) cloud through the lens of two developers. It will cover the initial request for experimental nodes from OSIC, the provisioning of these nodes, the deployment of OpenStack, and the testing done once the deployment was complete. Test results include behavior of the rabbit message queue at a 66 node scale as well as comparisons between the Linux Bridge and Open vSwitch ML2 plugins in neutron.
