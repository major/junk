Using OpenStack to Test Baremetal Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many OpenStack (and other) deployment frameworks have a way to do bare metal provisioning as part of the deployment. However, due to cost and security reasons, it’s extremely difficult to use actual hardware for continuous integration (CI) testing of this functionality. A number of solutions exist, but they all have drawbacks, such as poor security, flexibility, scalability, or performance. Wouldn't it be nice to take advantage of OpenStack to solve all those problems at once? It would allow testing infrastructure to be deployed on-demand, potentially eliminating much of the need for dedicated bare metal CI hardware. This session will explain how to use OpenStack instances to test bare metal-style deployments, including deployment of OpenStack itself.
