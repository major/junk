Continuous Delivery at Scale: Scaling Jenkins with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will cover how we run Jenkins at scale on top of OpenStack, and how the product is continuously built, tested and deployed using OpenStack. The Jenkins platform can be dynamically scaled to run jobs across hundreds of Jenkins masters, on Docker containers distributed across the OpenStack cluster or full virtual machines. Jenkins build agents are dynamically created based on load, isolating job execution and allowing a better allocation of resources. This presentation will show the challenges of continuous delivering distributed applications built on OpenStack, particularly JVM ones, by sharing a real world use case.
