User Messages - Async Error Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For quite some time, OpenStack services have wanted to be able to send messages to API end users. In Newton, both the Cinder and Manila projects have implemented the concept of User Messages as a way to inform users of the status of asynchronous operations. This presentation will demonstrate the use of this feature via the Horizon UI, project CLIs, and the API.
