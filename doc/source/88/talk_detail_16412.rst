Beyond Refstack:  The Interop Challenge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is really big on interoperability.  It has a board chartered committee to drive ever more encompassing interop tests and a project to help run those (and soon other) interop test sets.  But, these efforts are painfully limited due to the youthfulness of OpenStack, the software collection.  So, what can we do to aid interop without stepping on toes?  A consortium of companies have agreed to collaborate on (drum roll, please) The Interop Challenge! The Interop Challenge is using the OpenStack community to create a collection of applications that use the most attainable OpenStack tools (heat and murano) to demonstrate specific workloads for the cloud.  And the challenge is for these community created applications to run successfully across all and any participating vendor's products and/or services. Come join in the fun!


* **Rochelle Grober** *(Rocky is an industry veteran, with experience spanning computer bring up to AI, networks and embedded. But her attention always seems to return to close to the metal, large infrastructure. Starting out in EE, she migrated to SW development then on to QA and SW Process, which is why she is a champion for operations, interoperability and usability. She has been aware and peripherally involved in Open Source since the original creation of Copy Left, but is finally fully emersed in it now, as an OpenStack resource within Huawei. She brings many years of experience in large scale systems and operations, SOA, SAAS, mobile (oh, wait, that's not a TLA!) to the table, along with experience in multiple verticals and other business jargon. But most importantly, she melds a passion for quality performance with a pragmatism gained in the real world.)*

Her responsibilities include providing technical leadership for proof-of-concept, scalability design & testing. Catherine is the PTL of the Refstack project for the Mitaka cycle.)*
