Enabling Application Delivery with Kubernetes and OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing a container-centric approach to infrastructure. It offers developers a way to deploy applications quickly and predictably be it locally, in a public or private cloud, or even across multiple clouds. Kubernetes is in the process of evolving to take better advantage of the facilities provided by OpenStack clouds to provide an ideal platform for modern containerized applications while the applications  themselves remain infrastructure agnostic.
