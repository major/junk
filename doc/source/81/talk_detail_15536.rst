rkt, runC, LXC: How are we running containers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers have become the new hot topic in the last few years. This is not the least reason why we now have multiple container runtimes. A container runtime is simply the low-level engine hiding behind all of the fancy commands we use to run a container. Usually the runtimes job is done silently in the background. A few years ago there were only very few feature-rich container runtime implementations. Now we have multiple and all promise to be both easy to use, feature-rich and secure by default. In this talk we will try to bridge the gap between a higher-level and a low-level view on what different container runtimes do. We will try to answer what they have in common and where they differ.
