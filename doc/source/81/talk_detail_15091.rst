Live Container Migration on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Think VM migration is cool?  Wait until you see container migration in action!In this session we will first discuss runC (https://runc.io/) - the Open Container Initiative's (OCI) reference container runtime, and its relationship to the Docker runtime. Secondly we'll look at some of its features and capabilities, including features like checkpoint/restore which have not been exposed (yet) in the Docker runtime. Finally, we'll demonstrate live migration of container workloads between OpenStack Nova hosts.
