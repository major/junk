Load Balancing Containers in Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes simplify deployment and management of containerized applications across a cluster of machines. The OpenStack community has embraced Kubernetes with projects like Magnum. One key part of any high-performance web application is load balancing. Kubernetes provides built-in support for TCP/UDP load balancing and provides the Ingress resource to configure HTTP load balancers. This resource, however, covers only simple use cases, which leaves users on their own when applications need to support advanced use cases such as WebSocket, extended content-based routing, session persistence, etc. NGINX is a high-performance open source load balancer as well as a content cache and web server. The fact that it is lightweight and highly scalable makes it a great load balancing solution for Kubernetes, and explains why community members are embracing this solution for their containerized applications.
