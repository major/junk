Multi-tenancy Kubernetes Container Cluster with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In order to make Kubernetes containter cluster work in Multi-tenancy cases, we make use of Keystone to be Authorization/Authentication provider for container clusters integrated with OpenStack IaaS, to support Multi-tenant scenarios. In this presentation, we will show a deep dive how Kubernetes containter clusters use Keystone as the Authorization/Authentication provider, and pass the same role to Neutron, Cinder etc. other OpenStack components, make container clusters part of OpenStack.
