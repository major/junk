High performance ephemeral storage backend for Containers in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As more and more workloads shift from running in virtualized environments to containers, there is a need for high performance ephemeral storage backend in OpenStack. In this session, you will be introduced to a OpenStack storage provider which can be used with Magnum or Kuryr which combines memory (RAM) and commodity SSD to form a high performance ephemeral storage backend optimized for container based workloads.
