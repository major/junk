Self Healing Cloud: Predictive Analysis before it cost you time and money
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data center is far more complex today than it was a decade ago. The traditional “set and forget” approach to backup and recovery is no longer relevant. New challenges demand new approaches, one of which is the use of analytics to increase the value that backup and recovery provides your business. Self-Healing: for automatic repair or re-provisioning of new resources when a stack becomes unhealthy or a resource is not performing as expected. Integration of OpenStack with Kubernetes has built in self-healing mechanisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling, and replicating containers. As a user, you just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met at all times on the cluster. We’ve all had issues troubleshooting OpenStack services, whether it’s in the pre-build architecture or post build service failure.
