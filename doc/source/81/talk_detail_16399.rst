Containers in the Enterprise: Are We There Yet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn how containers can empower software developers to unlock new value for your enterprise. For enterprises, implementing containers and container cluster management is all about giving application developers a more agile, responsive and efficient cloud infrastructure. For cloud operators, however, delivering that infrastructure is a big departure from the days of VMs. This presentation will give the audience greater insights into: what the adoption curve looks like for containers in the enterprise benefits CIOs can realize—versus the risks—from jumping in now rather than waiting how VMs and containers might—or might not—work in tandem to achieve agile infrastructure goals how OpenStack and Kubernetes can deliver VMs and containers via one control plane how terms like “enterprise ready” can be loaded and unhelpful what new tools are emerging to help agile infra operators deliver the service levels and security that app devs need
