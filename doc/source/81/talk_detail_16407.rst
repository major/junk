Cinder, Manila, Kolla, Docker: The challenges and opportunities of deploying OpenStack on Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a highly distributed platform consisting of multiple services, each with their own software dependency stack. Managing the lifecycle (from deployment through update and upgrade) of these services along with their dependencies poses interesting challenges - even more so when you need to ensure desired availability for these services. One way to deal with these challenges is by containerizing OpenStack services. This can not only simplify deployment, scaling, and updates, but also allow the operator to deal with each service as a discrete unit. The Kolla Project provides the necessary tools to simplify deployment and orchestration of OpenStack services on containers. Manila's new container driver also enables us to exploit a Docker container as a share server instead of a virtual machine.  In this session, we'll discuss the advantages and challenges of deploying OpenStack on containers and how the approach impacts OpenStack Cinder and Manila.
