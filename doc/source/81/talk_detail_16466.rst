~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every company starting to look at a platform for their new agile project face the same questions, should i buy a PaaS or should i build a CaaS. If they chose to build, then they must chose the right Orchestration engine and once again choices made so far often makes reversibility harder. Fortunately Openstack is already a plateform of choice for PaaS and CaaS. Let's demonstrate how Openstack Magnum will help you to adress your CaaS requirements from POC to production.
