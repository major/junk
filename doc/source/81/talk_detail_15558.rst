Enable server-less applications – with Docker ready infrastructure and DevOps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How to allow non Openstack experts to transform applications to open cloud environments (Public or Private), while keeping control on their applications deployment whatever the underlying infrastructure. During this session, you will learn how this is possible thanks to containers : - Enable an efficient and secure infrastructure management - Migrate smoothly to cloud native applications DevOps and application lifecycle management - Manage dynamically your applications capacities (independently of the underlying supply layer (VM, Bare Metal, private / public Cloud).   During our session, we will illustrate this with a OpenStack cloud platform as an example of underlying platform. Design your infrastructure for optimized DevOps – and forget about it with your infra-agnostic applications : this is the path to fully leverage cloud promises !
