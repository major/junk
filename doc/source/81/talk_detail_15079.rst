Docker Container overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Docker Engine: The Docker engine is for enabling the realization of purpose-specific as well as generic Docker containers Docker engine is analogus to a KVM in the virtual machine world. It allows the container virtualization at the OS level Docker container: the read-write layer is the container layer, Docker pulls the required image and its parent image. It continues to pull all the parent images until it reaches the base image. Docker Registry: A service responsible for hosting and distributing images. The default registry is the Docker Hub. Docker Repository: A collection of related images (usually providing different versions of the same application or service).
