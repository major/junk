Dev and Ops - Separate Islands No More!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Bringing the power of infrastructure to applications by bridging the gaps between Developers and Operations. Application intent can be communicated to infrastructure for better reliability and performance. The key is to make infrastructure, and application intent policies available for developers to consume in an easy and seamless way. In this session we will share how we are leveraging OpenStack and other completely open source and vendor neutral technologies, that enable developers to attach application intent for infrastructure to provide optimized treatment.Â  Using OpenStack Magnum, we will deploy Docker containerized applications on kubernetes scheduler with application intent and other operational policies enforcement via project Contiv.
