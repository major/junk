Free speed! It's not even illegal!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many users who are interested in the bare-metal speed of containers, even those who may not even know it. In this talk, I'll cover how to use nova-LXD with your OpenStack, and what that experience will feel like for end users. In particular, I'll discuss what sorts of things users can't be allowed to do safely in containers today and what sort of work is happening in the kernel to allow this. I'll also discuss what things may *never* be safe for users, and what OpenStack could do to potentially make using containers easier for users.
