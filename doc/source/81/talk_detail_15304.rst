The Combinations between Containers and Openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container technologies have gained significant popularity in the last a few years, and several projects attempt to combine container technologies with OpenStack to address different problems such as multi-tenancy, resource management, monitoring, network, storage, and more. In this session, we will talk about the trend of Containers and OpanStack, such as containers on OpenStack and OpenStack in Containers. We will give a brief introduction to various container-focused projects/sub-projects such as Magnum, Kolla, Kuryr, Murano, nova-docker, nova-lxc, nova-lxd. Then, we will highlight the new container project, called Zun. We will explain the rationales to create this project, and emphasize the use cases this project aims to address. Finally, we will do a comparison of the projects above and explain how these projects will help users run containerized workloads on OpenStack.
