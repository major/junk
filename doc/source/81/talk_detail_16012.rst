Kolla and Kubernetes and labs, oh my!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As community developers at AT&T, we desired a tool that allowed us to deploy scalable clouds to our development labs with ease.  In order to embrace community best practices and to allow our development lab to scale, we decided to evaluate kolla and determine whether it would be a great choice for our team.  With the emergence of kolla-kubernetes, we found a tool that could allow us to better manage our development labs, and also allowed us to evaluate kolla-kubernetes as a proof of concept for future production deployments.
