OpenStack is an Application! Deploy and Manage Your Stack with Kolla-Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack consists of interrelated software components that control hardware pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter that are difficult to install, manage, and upgrade. With Kubernetes, each of the services can be viewed as applications.  Combined, they form a complex application that Kubernetes is capable of managing. Kubernetes provides high-level abstractions built around the needs of complex production systems like OpenStack. This provides an alternative approach to operations enabling clusters to be more easily operated, managed, and automated. In addition, Kubernetes has native tooling which simplifies otherwise hard problems like HA or upgrades. In this talk, the kolla-k8s team will demonstrate how Kubernetes solves the "Day 1" problem of deployment as well as "Day 2" operations like configuration, reconfiguration, failure recovery, and upgrades.  We will also demonstrate a production ready, highly available OpenStack based on kolla-k8s.
