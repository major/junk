Kuryr - Here Comes Advanced Services for Container Networking!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kuryr's goal is to make Neutron networking available to containers in their most widespread usages.Kuryr bridges the gap between the container orchestration engines like Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos and the OpenStack networking. It exposes all of the production grade Neutron capabilities and services to large scale container consumers. In Mitaka we presented our plans for Kubernetes integration and nested containers; for Newton we are enriching these enviorments with OpenStack advanced services such as Security Groups and Load Balancers. We show how a seamless set of advanced networking services and policies for containers, VMs, bare metal and nested containers can be provided by leveraging Kuryr with OpenStack.
