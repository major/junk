NFV Solution Using Containers as VNFs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Docker, with its rich Open Source ecosystem, has gained lot of popularity these days. This talk explores the opportunities of using docker containers as VNFs for the NFV. Docker has always been referred to as stateless and volatile. There has been much debate on the adequacy of replacing VMs with containers. This talk focuses on: Characteristics of VNFs NFV Management & Orchestration and how containers could fit in that space Advantages, potential risks and downsides of using containers in termsl of architecture, stability and cost when used as a VNF Using Docker, Neutron and Kuryr, a demonstration of OpenStack based Service Function Chaining.

I work with Telco and I am keen on addressing the challenges in OpenStack deployment in real-time Telco production environment and coming up with potential solution. I focus on building potential NFV solututions to address the challenges in OpenStack deployment in Telco. I currently work with Service function chaining and OpenStack Magnum, Containers. Â  I used to work for @WalmartLabs (e-commerce domain). I have experience in deploying OpenStack for a huge production environment. I have also worked on implementing Storage as Service using Cinder and Ceph for Walmart Production cloud.)*

He has contibuted in the past to the networking stack of oVirt, Libvirt nova-docker and MidoNet. His recent focus has been on Container Software Defined Networking and Container projects like OpenStack Magnum and Mesosphere.)*
