Containers without Chaos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container technology is gaining traction within the OpenStack community. While one of the goals is to make developers’ lives easier, containers alone won’t solve development and deployment issues. Having a strong and automated tool set for service discovery, networking, and load balancing are critical when your applications need to scale. In this presentation, we will share best practices for service discovery and registration in your OpenStack environment – a complex task. We’ll demonstrate how to implement these practices with NGINX, the top software-based application delivery platform available today, and the most downloaded application on Docker Hub. We’ll also cover multiple methods of automating load balancing and service discovery to take advantage of available open source solutions.
