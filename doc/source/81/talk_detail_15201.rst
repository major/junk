Providing Container Storage Service with Fuxi and Magnum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Fuxi is an ancient Chinese God who taught people skills for living such as fishing, knitting. In choosing Fuxi as the name of our new OpenStack project, we aim to let containers fully utilize all of OpenStack storage services such as Cinder, Swift, Manilla.In this talk we will introduce the key concepts and and the architecture of Fuxi.  We will examine how Fuxi can be integrated with Container Orchestration Engines deployed by Magnum.  We will share our vision on future storage support for containers in OpenStack and our potential relationship with project Kuryr.
