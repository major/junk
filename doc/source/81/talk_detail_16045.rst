Magnum is not the OpenStack Containers service? How about Zun?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers are hot. Everyone love them. OpenStack is undergoing a continuous evolution toward full-edged container support. Currently there are various projects which try to enable containers on Openstack like Nova-docker, Murano, Heat etc., but none of them have been proven to be the perfect solution. Magnum aimed to make containers available as first class resource in Openstack but went in a different direction recently. In the Austin summit, the Magnum community decided to limit the scope to the management of Container Orchestration Engines and leave the management of containers to a new project which is now called Zun. In this session, we will brief the recent change of Magnum mission statement. Then, we will introduce the Zun project, its targeted use cases, and the rationales to create this project. We will also welcome use cases, ideas from attendees if any.
