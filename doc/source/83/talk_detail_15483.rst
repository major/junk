During the fast developing, Neutron hit some issues about how to maintain the consistence of the API and how to assure the stablity of Neutron when it contains so much subprojects. This topic will introduce the current status of Neutron community and introduce what is Neutron Staduim, how to join in it, the developer or companies who want add a new sub-project to Neutron Staduim should follow this new rule. Finally, we will share our experience of adding BGP to Neutron and give some advices to add a new sub-project to Neutron Staduim.
