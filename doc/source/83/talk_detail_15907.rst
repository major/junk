Why contributing to OpenStack makes you a better developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will provide a detailed picture of what developers can learn by contributing upstream and how this can benefit their employers and downstream work.In our experience, joining the OpenStack community by contributing upstream makes you a better developer by improving both your technical and non-technical skills. This is something that can often be overlooked. It is easy to think of upstream development only in terms of features added or lines of code. But it's more than that. It's a chance to grow and gain experience by collaborating with subject matter experts from around the world.We will describe how you will learn from the technology, development and test methodologies OpenStack uses. How OpenStack development tooling "automates all the things". How strong review processes lead not just to better code, but better coders. How to collaborate and reach consensus with developers distributed across geographies -- with a healthy culture of respect. Â
