Pushing your QA upstream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Quality Assurance (QA) is an extremely important part of the software development process nowadays. OpenStack is not different and has a growing set of tools and infrastructure to improve its quality: integration tests (tempest and tempest plugins), performance tests (rally) and a great CI (zuul). In this talk, you will learn why you should push your QA tests upstream and how to do it, including: adding a gate job, adding tests to it, creating a custom DevStack deployment and circumventing possible limitations.
