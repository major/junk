How to fully participate in the OpenStack community: our journey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Participating in an Open-source community can be scary. Participating in OpenStack can even be overwhelming. In this presentation, Bruno and Wajdi will talk about the culture change that occurs when shifting from being a consumer of open-source software and technologies, to becoming a participant in OpenStack. They will explain how you can address your team's fear and anxiety during this period of transition by progressively convincing them of the benefits of participating.
