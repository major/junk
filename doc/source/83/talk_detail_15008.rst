A Brief Guide To Contribution: Navigating the Treacherous 7 Seas of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At the OpenStack Innovation Center we are growing the number of upstream OpenStack developers. We have collected a wealth of knowledge, tips, and tricks for beginners to thrive in the OpenStack community and want to share that knowledge. Our goal is to improve the newcomer experience so that other OpenStack developers can succeed and make an impact on the project. This talk will help them get more out of the documentation, be more efficient with the OpenStack tools, and have a greater voice in the community.
