OpenStack by the Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Gerrit and git provide a vast wealth of data about the history of change proposals, commits, and reviews. There are a few existing tools to visualize the statistics provided by these tools. The existing tools aren't very good at painting the greater picture or analyzing the trends around contribution. In this session, we'll look at larger trends in the data and what the data can tell us about changes in project growth rates and charting the shifting focus of developers and reviewers over time. Let's look at some pretty graphs and analyze the story the statistics tell us about OpenStack and the projects that comprise it.
