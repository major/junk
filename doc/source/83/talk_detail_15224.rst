From First Contribution To PTL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn about contributing to OpenStack! I'll be covering every stage of upstream development, from the very beginning to becoming a Project Team Lead; how to work within the OpenStack upstream ecosystem and make valuable contributions right away. The presentation will cover: - How to align with the community goals, and how to promote your own. - How to quickly fit in and make important contributions to the project, whether its reviews, code, bug triage, usage data/feedback or documentation. - What to do as a new contributor, core, or PTL, and in turn what to expect from people in those roles.
