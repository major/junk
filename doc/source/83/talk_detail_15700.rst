A Cloudy Forecast - Contributing Vendor Drivers to Upstream OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack was designed and built for cloud, but existing deployments in many data centers are a bit more traditional. As operators work to converge cloud infrastructure, integrating with these platforms is key to simplifying data centers around the world. Fortunately OpenStack has a broad, extensible driver model to support vendors contributing for their platforms upstream - but that doesn't always make those initial contributions seem easy! In this session we'll discuss the path we took while contributing support for a traditional platform to various upstream OpenStack projects, how we changed our platform to integrate with upstream technologies, the challenges and rewards, and provide tips to help navigate upstream.
