Become a great OpenStack contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you are new to OpenStack, the process of becoming a contributor and dealing with all the things you suddenly need to know can be overwhelming. I was there just a year ago. Knowing your code is just the beginning with IRC, gerrit and community engagement to deal with as well. But it doesn't have to be stressful! In this session we will be talking about the key things to know going into the world of OpenStack and how to be a successful and happy contributor! By coming to this session you will learn how code reviews work, what makes up a helpful code review, IRC and the unwritten rules of community ettiquette and potholes to avoid. I hope that at the end of this session you will go away excited to get stuck into those code reviews and aware that there is an amazing community who will be there to help you out and help you get started in this amazing community.
