Designing in the open, Smaug as a success story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Since its inception in the Tokyo Summit, Project Smaug (Data Protection as a Service) rapidly grow to become an OpenStack Big Tent project.A key factor to Smaug’s success story was the collaboration in the design effort, which took place completely “in the open”: from initial high-level specification, to components design, UMLs and documentation.In this talk we wish to share our perspective on how independent software vendors can benefit not only from contributing code to the open source community, but also from designing projects in the open from the get go.
