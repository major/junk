The ABCs of Becoming an OpenStack ATC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What does it mean to be an OpenStack active technical contributor? It means that you are a developer or designer or support engineer or tester or project manager or writer or END USER and you’d like to become involved in an open source project. It means that you want contribute to a specific project within OpenStack, like TripleO, which is a project within the umbrella space, and that you’ll join the RDO community for guidance, feedback, and support. And, sure, while it’s actually more like ABCDEF, GEE, I'm hoping you'll enjoy this overview of OpenStack and what it is to become an ATC.
