How to Become an Advanced Contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the fastest growing open source project supported by a large community base with a wide variety of skills. For a new contributor, the journey from figuring out how to get started to becoming a valued member of a team might seem daunting and not so obvious. Most projects have very good documentation on how to get started and how to contribute, but beyond that how can one become a valued member and improve visibility beyond just code contributions? In this presentation, we will try to address these questions based on our own OpenStack journey and we will share what we learnt during the process including tools, tips and general advice on how to contribute to any project. The presenters for this talk are Trevor McCasland, an amatuer member from the OpenStack Mentoring program and active contributor to the Trove and Neutron project and Mariam John who is a core on the Trove project.
