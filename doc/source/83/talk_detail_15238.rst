Names, not Numbers: Becoming a Respected OpenStack Contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Anyone can be an OpenStack contributor but what does it take to be a respected OpenStack contributor? You’ve been fixing all of the low-hanging-fruit bugs that you could get your hands on, plus-one-ing like nobody’s business, and you’re in all of the IRC chat rooms. But you still feel like you aren’t quite part of the OpenStack Community. What do you do now that you’re comfortable with the processes involved to take your contributions to the next level?
