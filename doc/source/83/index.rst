A Brief Guide To Contribution: Navigating the Treacherous 7 Seas of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At the OpenStack Innovation Center we are growing the number of upstream OpenStack developers. We have collected a wealth of knowledge, tips, and tricks for beginners to thrive in the OpenStack community and want to share that knowledge. Our goal is to improve the newcomer experience so that other OpenStack developers can succeed and make an impact on the project. This talk will help them get more out of the documentation, be more efficient with the OpenStack tools, and have a greater voice in the community.

If I don't live in US, how do I become a significant contributor to OpenStack ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most of the OpenStack project, workgroup, and comittee meetings are happening in US or during US working hours. As someone who lives outside of US, how do I keep up with the latest development of OpenStack, and effectively contribute and collaborate with other OpenStack developers and members? In this panel, we will have non-US managers and developers who will share their challenges, experiences, and learnings to be integrated into the OpenStack community, and to be a significant contributer to OpenStack. Also, we will brainstorm on ideas on how we can make OpenStack a true global movement.

Rock the (dev) docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As developers and support team members, operators and hobbyists, you routinely communicate your expert product knowledge as you work. First time contributors are always encouraged to commit to the documentation. This is because it is a fast, efficient, and effective way for new contributors to learn how to contribute and take a look at what OpenStack projects are working on currently. In a nutshell: Software documentation is an integral part of any software development process. OpenStack manuals has a strict set of conventions which each new contributor follows, just as each development project has a set of guidelines for any code patches. So let’s extend these guidelines to each project’s developer documentation. In this session I will cover: How to start with your first dev doc commit How to structure your developer documentation for the best usability and readability How to ensure you are following the documentation guidelines How to move beyond your initial contribution

How to Become an Advanced Contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the fastest growing open source project supported by a large community base with a wide variety of skills. For a new contributor, the journey from figuring out how to get started to becoming a valued member of a team might seem daunting and not so obvious. Most projects have very good documentation on how to get started and how to contribute, but beyond that how can one become a valued member and improve visibility beyond just code contributions? In this presentation, we will try to address these questions based on our own OpenStack journey and we will share what we learnt during the process including tools, tips and general advice on how to contribute to any project. The presenters for this talk are Trevor McCasland, an amatuer member from the OpenStack Mentoring program and active contributor to the Trove and Neutron project and Mariam John who is a core on the Trove project.


* **Trevor McCasland** *(Trevor is a recent college graduate working at AT&T where he contributes to Neutron and Trove OpenStack projects. He has been contributing to OpenStack since February 2016.)*

Cutting Some Slack: Decoding IRC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

IRC is the chat solution of choice for many free/open source projects, including OpenStack. It's freely licensed. It's free to use. It's free (as in puppy) to set up and maintain. It's discoverable. If you want to communicate with people on OpenStack projects you need to learn how to use IRC. Unfortunately, much of the criticism of IRC is true: It's an arcane system, and unfortunately it's one whose documentation was mostly written ages ago by people who didn't have usability or UX in mind. Even with those docs, there is a lot of tribal knowledge locked in the brains of the grey haired members of open source, making it more difficult to get started using the technology. This talk will demystify IRC and make it almost as easy (and maybe even as enjoyable) as using a different chat system. You'll learn how to get connected and find channels, how to claim your nickname, how to navigate the enigmatic social mores, and more!

Have It Your Way: Maximizing Drive-Thru Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

They drop by, they fix their particular problem, they leave. They're the drive-through contributor. While, yes, we all would prefer that these people stick around and join the OpenStack community, there's no denying that a good drive-thru contribution adds value to your project. A strong argument can be made that the more drive-thru contributors your project has, the healthier the project process and ecosystem. It shows that you've set up a process which is easy to understand, easy to follow, and which makes it easy to contribute. In a situation like that, it increases the opportunities for new contributors to become new community members and everyone is a winner. This talk will present: * Reasons people become drive-thrus (both why they show up & why they leave)* Methods for maximizing drive-thru contributions* Overall advantages of those methods for your project* An argument for using number of drive-thru contributions as a metric for project health

The Struggle - Managing Open Source and Proprietary Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With impending deadlines, limited resources, and upset managers, we must focus most of our time on proprietary projects while still maintaining activity in the OpenStack Community. It honestly is a constant struggle, but many of us have found ways to maintain activity without affecting our personal lives. This panel will go over how it is being done today. As services evolve, companies must determine what goes in OpenSource and what to keep proprietary. We will go over what can and can’t be contributed, what must remain intellectual property, and how can intellectual property be licensed for use in an OpenSource Project. This panel will go over the following topics: How different OpenStack Developers maintain active in the Community, while working on proprietary items. Intellectual Property: What can and cannot be contributed. How non-developers(Project Managers) are involved in the community. Stigma behind developer vs documentation contributions.

Finding your way around the OpenStack-Dev mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A practical guide to the OpenStack-Dev mailing list. OpenStack-Dev is one of the more active Open Source software related mailing lists around.  Averaging around 600 messages or 180 unique threads per week it's a sometimes daunting, sometimes vexing but often funny and usually informative thing to read. It was these attributes that led the author to start a weekly summary - Last Week on OpenStack Dev (aka Lwood) - in June of 2015 which has gone on to become a well regarded part of the broader OpenStack commons. Attendees at this session will gain insight into the history of the list, how best to make use of it to enhance their knowledge of OpenStack, how to get involved in discussions, how to avoid asking questions the wrong way and other hints and tips for life on openstack-dev. A short tour of recent threads - some funny, some serious, a quick look at other OpenStack related lists as well as some stats about the ebb and flow of openstack-dev list traffic will also be presented.

A Cloudy Forecast - Contributing Vendor Drivers to Upstream OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack was designed and built for cloud, but existing deployments in many data centers are a bit more traditional. As operators work to converge cloud infrastructure, integrating with these platforms is key to simplifying data centers around the world. Fortunately OpenStack has a broad, extensible driver model to support vendors contributing for their platforms upstream - but that doesn't always make those initial contributions seem easy! In this session we'll discuss the path we took while contributing support for a traditional platform to various upstream OpenStack projects, how we changed our platform to integrate with upstream technologies, the challenges and rewards, and provide tips to help navigate upstream.

The Vitrage Story: from Nothing to the Big Tent in Six Months
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The story of how CloudBand took Vitrage from nothing to the Big Tent in just six months. Way back when, around 6 months ago, a few CloudBand developers realized that RCA had been overlooked in OpenStack. They decided to work it up in python, and put together the basic code for what is now known as Vitrage – an RCA and Deduced Alarms service that supplies insights about OpenStack. Vitrage was first introduced to the OpenStack community at the Tokyo summit – we came with diagrams, our experience from CloudBand and a lot of passion. We met key OpenStack people from various projects, who realized there was a real need for this, and we got their blessing. This is a story of going from an idea to a concept to a working code to a community and to becoming officially part of OpenStack – all this in record time. We will describe the steps we took along the way, the decision points, the failures and successes that led us along this route. This is a story for anyone dreaming about the Big Tent.

Why contributing to OpenStack makes you a better developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will provide a detailed picture of what developers can learn by contributing upstream and how this can benefit their employers and downstream work.In our experience, joining the OpenStack community by contributing upstream makes you a better developer by improving both your technical and non-technical skills. This is something that can often be overlooked. It is easy to think of upstream development only in terms of features added or lines of code. But it's more than that. It's a chance to grow and gain experience by collaborating with subject matter experts from around the world.We will describe how you will learn from the technology, development and test methodologies OpenStack uses. How OpenStack development tooling "automates all the things". How strong review processes lead not just to better code, but better coders. How to collaborate and reach consensus with developers distributed across geographies -- with a healthy culture of respect.

The ABCs of Becoming an OpenStack ATC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What does it mean to be an OpenStack active technical contributor? It means that you are a developer or designer or support engineer or tester or project manager or writer or END USER and you’d like to become involved in an open source project. It means that you want contribute to a specific project within OpenStack, like TripleO, which is a project within the umbrella space, and that you’ll join the RDO community for guidance, feedback, and support. And, sure, while it’s actually more like ABCDEF, GEE, I'm hoping you'll enjoy this overview of OpenStack and what it is to become an ATC.

Become a great OpenStack contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you are new to OpenStack, the process of becoming a contributor and dealing with all the things you suddenly need to know can be overwhelming. I was there just a year ago. Knowing your code is just the beginning with IRC, gerrit and community engagement to deal with as well. But it doesn't have to be stressful! In this session we will be talking about the key things to know going into the world of OpenStack and how to be a successful and happy contributor! By coming to this session you will learn how code reviews work, what makes up a helpful code review, IRC and the unwritten rules of community ettiquette and potholes to avoid. I hope that at the end of this session you will go away excited to get stuck into those code reviews and aware that there is an amazing community who will be there to help you out and help you get started in this amazing community.

Is OpenStack Facing The Tragedy of the Commons?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Tragedy of the Commons describes a shared-resource situation where individuals acting according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good and depleting the resources. Open Source project like OpenStack are similar share-resource situations - community, code, intellectual property and even brand are all commonly-held resources that members participate in the development and take advantage of the resources in support of a common good. OpenStack is commercialized by many vendors often pulling in directions, often perceived as contrary to common good. Is there a way we tell when this is happening by looking at the development practices and apply data analytics to identify when this is or is not occurring? In this talk, we take a look at the data behind the project(s) that make up OpenStack, look for signs of metric gamification, company-driven auto-reviews, and other indicators of self-interest driven software practices.

OpenStack by the Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Gerrit and git provide a vast wealth of data about the history of change proposals, commits, and reviews. There are a few existing tools to visualize the statistics provided by these tools. The existing tools aren't very good at painting the greater picture or analyzing the trends around contribution. In this session, we'll look at larger trends in the data and what the data can tell us about changes in project growth rates and charting the shifting focus of developers and reviewers over time. Let's look at some pretty graphs and analyze the story the statistics tell us about OpenStack and the projects that comprise it.
