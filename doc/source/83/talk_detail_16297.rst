How to Create and Maintain an OpenStack Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Training Labs solves an important challenge with OpenStack by providing a multinode OpenStack cluster based on VM which could run on any modern commodity hardware like Laptops and Desktops. Training Labs provides an easy one command deployment process and abstracts the complexity of deploying the entire cloud for beginners and veterans of OpenStack. It could a beginner trying to learn OpenStack for the COA exam or a veteran who wants to setup the entire environment and just focus on one project of OpenStack.

Adam has been a passionate supporter and developer of F/OSS since 1995, with a particular interest in automation and orchestration.  For the last 13 years his professional focus has been on Linux-oriented enterprise technologies in the data center. He holds a degree in Mathematics and Computation from Oxford University, and currently lives and works in London, UK. Adam juggles his IT career with a long-running parallel career as a musician, a (less successful) pre-occupation with marathons and triathlons, and occasionally also juggles balls, clubs, and fire.)*
