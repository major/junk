The Vitrage Story: from Nothing to the Big Tent in Six Months
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The story of how CloudBand took Vitrage from nothing to the Big Tent in just six months. Way back when, around 6 months ago, a few CloudBand developers realized that RCA had been overlooked in OpenStack. They decided to work it up in python, and put together the basic code for what is now known as Vitrage – an RCA and Deduced Alarms service that supplies insights about OpenStack. Vitrage was first introduced to the OpenStack community at the Tokyo summit – we came with diagrams, our experience from CloudBand and a lot of passion. We met key OpenStack people from various projects, who realized there was a real need for this, and we got their blessing. This is a story of going from an idea to a concept to a working code to a community and to becoming officially part of OpenStack – all this in record time. We will describe the steps we took along the way, the decision points, the failures and successes that led us along this route. This is a story for anyone dreaming about the Big Tent.
