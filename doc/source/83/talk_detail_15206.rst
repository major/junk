The Struggle - Managing Open Source and Proprietary Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With impending deadlines, limited resources, and upset managers, we must focus most of our time on proprietary projects while still maintaining activity in the OpenStack Community. It honestly is a constant struggle, but many of us have found ways to maintain activity without affecting our personal lives. This panel will go over how it is being done today. As services evolve, companies must determine what goes in OpenSource and what to keep proprietary. We will go over what can and can’t be contributed, what must remain intellectual property, and how can intellectual property be licensed for use in an OpenSource Project. This panel will go over the following topics: How different OpenStack Developers maintain active in the Community, while working on proprietary items. Intellectual Property: What can and cannot be contributed. How non-developers(Project Managers) are involved in the community. Stigma behind developer vs documentation contributions.
