I found a security bug, what happen's next ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session we’ll introduce the OpenStack Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) process to those who aren't familiar with OpenStack bug report. We’ll demonstrate the OpenStack vulnerability management team's typical workflow for handling security vulnerability reports, and we’ll share practical tips and tricks based on previous CVE bugs. You’ll learn how to successfully report a security bug in OpenStack, how we triage security reports, and what happens when a security fix is released.
