Common OpenStack rpm-packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Typical OpenStack software binary distributions consist of binary packages for the particular used distribution. At the Vancouver Summit the idea of joining the forces into a common RPM Packaging for OpenStack project, which is aiming to become a cross-distribution and cross-vendor effort to create common templates for building OpenStack packages for RPM based Linux and OpenStack distributions. RPM Packaging for OpenStack is an cross-distribution and cross-vendor effort and currently has contributions from Mirantis, Red Hat and SUSE. This talk gives an overview about the current project status, gives a glimpse at the tooling that has been developed, shows pitfalls and gives an outlook about the O-cycle goals for the project.
