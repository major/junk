Native HTML5 consoles for VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The VMware driver in Nova has support for VNC consoles since the early days. However, cloud operators are facing multiple problems with deployment, scalability and security when providing VNC consoles to OpenStack instances running on the VMware stack. During the last three releases of OpenStack we have made several API changes in Nova which allow using the native protocol for VMware consoles and solve the previous hassles with VNC. In this presentation we will show how to deploy Nova with support for VMware consoles and the advantages compared to VNC.
