OpenStack Requirements  : What we are doing, what to expect and whats next
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Syncing of requirements for OpenStack projects is a very important task since the way python package installation with pip works, this means that if you get lucky you'll end up with a working system. If you don't you can easily break all of OpenStack on a requirements update. Global requirements gives us a single place where we can evaluate these things so that we can make a global decision for OpenStack on the suitability of the library. The requirements team is trying hard to fulfil the REQUIREMENTS of managed projects with validating different requirements updates, auto-update of upper constraints for requirements to name a few tasks.
