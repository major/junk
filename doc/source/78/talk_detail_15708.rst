Data is Beautiful: Insights into your Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack deployments grow, the Gnocchi community aims to meet increased demands. With Gnocchi v3, the goal is to provide a scalable solution to track and monitor billions of individual datapoints across millions of metrics in a responsive manner. This talk highlights some of the changes made in the past version to improve performance and minimise storage footprint. It also will show some of the benchmark tests conducted over the past months which led to improved results. Additionally, it will provide architectural guidance on how to deploy your Gnocchi service. This talk will features lots of pretty graphs!
