Behind the Database: An Inside Look at OpenStack Trove Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Trove, the OpenStack Database as a Service offering, supports both relational and non-relational databases, enabling users to administer almost a dozen different types of databases. This session will explore what actually happens when a user issues a Trove create against MongoDB versus MySQL or Couchbase. This talk will highlight: An overview of the administration of different databases with Trove's Database as a Service. A look into what OpenStack Trove does “under the covers”. Challenges encountered with designing Trove compatibility with different databases. The databases we will discuss include both relational and non-relational databases such as Cassandra, Couchbase, and MySQL, all supported by Trove while the Tesora DBaaS Platform runs on Mitaka, Liberty, and Kilo.
