How Shadow Users is powering Federation in Keystone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Find out how Keystone is unifying identities and extending Federation to make Federated identities a first class citizen! Shadow Users is a new feature that unifies identities (LDAP, Federation…) and is powering Federation. Thus, all of Keystone identities are now stored in the database, allowing for referential integrity and improved performance, as well facilitating account linking. Meaning, that the new identity model allows a user to be associated to an LDAP identity and a Federated identity for example. And there is even more! Because of Shadow Users, Federated identities are now treated like any other identity and therefore, can receive concrete role assignments. This opens the door to a whole slew of features around Federation, such as automatically bootstrapping your users and projects through Federation. This talk will focus on the new features around unified identity and Federation, as well as upcoming features that will take Federated identities to the next level.
