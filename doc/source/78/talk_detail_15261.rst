Searchlight in Horizon: Finally a fast web UI for managing your cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk we'll present the speedy web features now available by using the new Searchlight-UI Horizon plugin. Learn about this exciting new feature and see how easy it isÂ to deploy! Searchlight is a cloud-resource indexing service which, coupled with new work in Horizon, gives users a simple, powerful, and pluggable interface for quickly navigating their resources and workflows. When using an indexed search, many of the paradigms of categorical navigation fade away, and new opportunities, like user-defined views and cross-resource monitoring, become possible. We'll look at use cases that are massively improved, provide some tips on how to quickly master search techniques, and demonstrate how to build your own library of searches so you can build views specific to your workflow
