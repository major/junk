Journey To FPGA - hardware accelerators orchestration in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nowadays we can observe significant growth of hardware accelerators usage to offload certain types of workloads from CPU. There are number of different hardware available today: GPU, FPGA based accelerators or even specialized ones like Googles' TPU. In this presentation we would like to focus on FPGA. We will discuss what are the use cases, how currently FPGA accelerators are used in OpenStack. Dynamic nature of FPGA leads to new challenges with resource management and scheduling. There are couple of initiatives to provide FPGA accelerators in projects like Nova and Nomad which we would like to present.


* **Zhipeng Huang** *(Zhipeng Huang is currently a standard manager and open source community operator for Huawei. His activities mainly involves open source projects like OPNFV, OpenStack, Open Container Project, OpenDaylight and so forth.)*

* **Roman Dobosz** *(Known as  a person with both feet on the ground, with a background of several different angles of software development – from heterogeneous large MES system to mobile solution, Roman is Software Engineer in Software Defined Infrastructure team at Intel. In OpenStack world he is relatively new, and his main activities are connected with work within the Win The Enterprise group, which main focus is to bring the OpenStack to the Enterprise around HA topics. Recently, he is involved in enabling non trivial resources like FPGA into OpenStack.)*

* **Fei Chen** *(Fei Chen is an OpenStack developer from IBM. He got this Ph.D on the direction of computer architecture, working on virtualization technology, heterogeneous computing and cloud technology. In recent years he focuses on the integration of FPGA, GPU heterogeneous computation and cloud infrastructure. He now is the technical lead of the acceleration service on IBM SuperVessel Cloud.)*
