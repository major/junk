What's New with OpenStack Trove in Newton, What's On Deck for Ocata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Trove, the Database as a Service project for OpenStack, has been evolving rapidly over the last several cycles and contains many new features in Newton. Work during the Newton cycle aimed at improving UX for both the operator and the end-user, expanding the capabilities across datastores and adding more availability and scalability support to databases. These features will be discussed in detail with particular attention to how the improvements address enterprise use cases. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of what’s on the roadmap for Ocata.
