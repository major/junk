~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Manila provides multi-tenant file-share services to OpenStack. It can work with default storage types, or through its driver model, with a range of storage backends. The ability to provide file-shares to serve existing applications, containers, DevOps environments, departmental shares, and other use cases broadens OpenStack’s storage capabilities.  As a result, with OpenStack rolling out in high-profile enterprises, Manila is rapidly gaining momentum with new features. Over the last cycle, the community has worked on a number of useful enhancements, including an updated installer for Fuel. Topics covered will include: Share Groups for performing tasks on groups of file shares Enhanced snapshot restoration capabilities Share migration and retyping capabilities Access Groups for shares to specify the same access policies to multiple shares Deployment using the Fuel plugin for Manila. and more.  Multiple demos will be included!
