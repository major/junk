The Future of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) through the eyes of OpenStack Vitrage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What is the future of RCA in OpenStack? Explore project Vitrage and the challenges ahead. Vitrage is a new and official OpenStack project dedicated to root cause analysis (RCA) and deduced insights into the behavior of the Cloud. With the help of a graphical model representing the different relationships between system entities, and a friendly UI, Vitrage hopes to achieve its mission of organizing, analyzing and visualizing a holistic view of the system. While Vitrage has already built strong foundations for delving deep into this realm, there is still much to be done.   In this session, we will sketch out the future of RCA and fault management in OpenStack, as seen from the perspective and experience of the Vitrage Project. Several central issues will be discussed, including role-based views of RCA, alarm aggregation, RCA history, multi-layered RCA and much more. We will survey these challenges, and outline options for addressing them in coming OpenStack releases.
