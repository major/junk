Daisy Distributed System Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Daisy is yet another installer like fule, juju etc. Previously, it is a closed source project which is used to deploy closed source openstack vairiations developed by ZTE. A couple of month ago we made it a opensource project to support original openstack distributions. Daisy is designed base upon experience and practice of software which running in the large data center. It will bring a bunch of cool stuff to speed up OpenStack deployment for large clusters.
