Freezer: What's new? Plugins and deduplication!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Freezer is the backup and restore solution for OpenStack. All OpenStack deployments are different. Freezer allows you to ensure your data is always ready, no matter the diversity of your environment, thanks to its flexibility to support any kind of storage, application or system.Backup policies sometimes force you to accumulate a big amount of data. Most of your storage ends up being taken by similar backups. How could we help freeing up space by saving only what's necessary? Join us while we present some exciting features we've been working on this cycle to solve these issues.Plugin layers: Adding a new backend storage or compatibility with an application has never been so simple. Your filesystem provides a shiny snapshotting capability? Freezer can now support it very easily. Let's talk about how we implemented this. Deduplication: We will present how we plan on implementing freezer-level deduplication for your backups.
