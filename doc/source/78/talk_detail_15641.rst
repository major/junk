Vitrage under-the-hood: a window into the inner workings of a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Go under-the-hood of OpenStack Vitrage to take a good look into the inner workings of a remarkable RCA engine.Vitrage is a new and official OpenStack project dedicated to Root Cause Analysis. Vitrage receives inputs from numerous data sources, both internal and external to OpenStack, and produces insights into what causes faults. But how does it do all this? This session is the place for anyone interested in getting in on a fascinating ride into the realm of Root Cause Analysis and fault management in OpenStack. We will take you on a tour of the features & architecture of the project, and then dive deep into its algorithmic core. Find out all about our innovative graph representation of the Cloud – the Vitrage Entity Graph – and understand how to populate it from the various data sources. We will discuss and demonstrate how Vitrage efficiently uncovers patterns in this graph, deals with conflicting fault-management policies, and generates RCA reports based on it.
