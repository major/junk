Ciao: A modern, secure, scalable and performant compute service for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Cloud Integrated Advanced Orchestration (ciao) project brings a fresh perspective to cloud software stacks. It rethinks cloud orchestration and networking by focusing on modern requirements, notably security, scalability, simplicity, workload agnosticism and continuous deployment. Ciao is implemented in Go and provides a highly performant cloud orchestration layer that is fully TLS based, requires minimal configuration and is easily updateable. Ciao relies on several OpenStack components, including Keystone, Glance, Cinder and Swift. In ciao, containers, VMs and bare metal host L2 interconnected, equal citizen user workloads, providing a scalable elastic cloud. This presentation describes the architectural innovations in the areas of scheduling, networking and component interconnection that allow ciao to meet the requirements of the modern cloud. It identifies where ciaoâ€™s implementation differs from OpenStack and explains how ciao integrates with several OpenStack components.
