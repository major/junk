Localize OpenStack better and better
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack I18n project translates OpenStack dashboard, documentation, and so on into various languages. Also, we create and maintain our toolchains. In June 2015, I18n working group became an official project. Then, we have become bigger project. This session covers recent I18n project efforts, such as Stacklytics integration (new metrics "translations"), translation glossary, release notes translation, and dashboard translation check site. Also, this session provides translation tips from some active language teams.
