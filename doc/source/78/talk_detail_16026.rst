Serve hot objects fast and move iced ones to the fridge! Place your Objects based on itâ€™s metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While object stores are predominantly used for archive, capabilities of multiprotocol access opens up newer use cases which require faster access to unstructured data. In SWIFT, with SwiftonFile open source modules which supports multiprotocol access, the object store sits over different tiers of storage pools that have different characteristics in terms of price/performance. Placing the right object at the right tier requires intelligent tiering of objects across the pools based on the object heat which is a direct reflection of it's access w.r.t time. Additionally, object store characteristic of having user defined metadata with objects can be used for tiering. With this, one can control tiering of objects based on object metadata, irrespective of when the metadata is updated.
