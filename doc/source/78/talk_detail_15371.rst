Spanning your overlay network across clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the up-take of Hybrid Cloud, spanning the network across clouds is becoming a necessity. However, this capability is as-of-yet not supported by the cloud infrastructure. Moreover, OpenStack networking is designed as a “single network domain”, lacking the model to define a network that crosses the cloud boundary. In a Hybrid Cloud environment, you want to be able to define a virtual network that connects your virtual machines, regardless of their network domain. In this session, we will present a solution and reference design that enables OpenStack to connect multiple remote networks, allowing users to establish Virtual Network connections between VMs across different clouds.
