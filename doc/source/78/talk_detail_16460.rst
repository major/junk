Fuel Me Once Shame On You, Fuel Me Twice Shame On Me
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Users are incredibly ingenious when using a product in new and unexpected ways. OpenStack Fuel had to endure the rigors of deploying a large infrastructure like AT&T's.  As a critical part of the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC), the Fuel community was challenged to implement change based on new perspectives and functional requirements in order to meet the needs of enterprise large scale deployments. AIC provided a complexity unseen by developer community and added new use cases, architecture design, and network intricacies. As a result the Fuel project has grown and improved in leaps. Find out how AIC helped to advance the Fuel project to be a more resilient and flexible solution.


* **Matthew Ernst** *(As part of AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC), I am involved in the management and development of Automated Deployment for AT&T's distributed clouds. Working with OpenStack since 2014, I have grown passionate about the possibilities that OpenStack enables corporations to provide innovative and cutting-edge capabilities. My role in AIC involves being a Scrum Master for the Fuel development team and the Production Support team that provides automation for current defects. As a leader in the automation space, I work to make sure the deployments are performed successfully by working with teams from development, automation, and deployment to better understand what is being deployed and how automation can help to improve the process.)*

* **Kayla Fromme** *(I am managing development of OpenStack core components (upstream and internal customizations) at AT&T and deployment of OpenStack using Fuel in enterprise data centers.  My first summit was Vancouver 2015.  I enjoy learning about OpenStack and how other companies are using & deploying OpenStack.  I joined the  Women of OpenStack shortly before the Austin Summit and I am looking forward to becoming more involved. In my spare time I like to snowboard, cheer on the St. Louis Cardinals, and play soccer. )*
