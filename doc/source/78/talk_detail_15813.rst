Shared Filesystems Management with Manila; a look forward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Manila is the OpenStack shared filesystem service that was announced September 2013. In January 2015 it was labeled as an officially incubated OpenStack program. Now with the current stable release in Mitaka, Manila is providing the management of file shares (for example, NFS and CIFS) as a core service to OpenStack. Manila currently works with a variety of vendors, including NetApp, Red Hat Storage (GlusterFS), EMC, IBM GPFS, Hitachi, HPE, and on a base Linux NFS server. In this session, we will provide an introduction to the Manila file share service, a description of the logical architecture of Manila and its API structure, examples of use cases, an exploration of whats coming in Newton from share replication, LVM, cephfs, data copy service, and a brief demo using NetApp.
