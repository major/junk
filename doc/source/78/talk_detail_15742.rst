Ironic Support of Hardware Configuration and Firmware Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  Ironic added support for RAID configuration, firmware setting and firmware update as part of the bare metal preparation for deployment.   With these features, users can automate hardware configuration, manage firmware and provision bare metal all within Ironic. Moreover, once ironic configures RAID or updates firmware, users can use the RAID level or firmware version as Nova flavor to place their workloads on a bare metal node with the matching RAID level or firmware version.   This feature can be used to optimize workload placement on bare metal instances. This session will give an overview and demo of these new Ironic capabilities.
