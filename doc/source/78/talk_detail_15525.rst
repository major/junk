OpenStack Charms: Project Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Charms project provides a flexible and scalable way for deploying and operating an OpenStack Cloud, based on operational experience and OpenStack feature enablement since the Essex release of OpenStack. The OpenStack Charms project joined the OpenStack Big Tent during the Newton development cycle. This session will provide an overview of what the OpenStack Charms provide, a retrospective of the last 6 months of development for the OpenStack Charms project, and details on our roadmap for the Octata release cycle.
