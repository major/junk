Manila and Cinder Under the Hood - Discussions & Q/A with a panel of developers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Come join us for an interactive session with a panel of OpenStack developers who work behind the scenes on OpenStack Cinder and Manila! They will share details about some of the things that they are working on, exciting new developments, and their thoughts on the future of these two projects. They will also answer any questions you may have regarding how things work under the hood. Panelists include Tom Barron, Alex Meade, Rodrigo Barbieri, Goutham Pacha Ravi, and Sumit Kumar.


* **Goutham Pacha Ravi** *(Goutham is an active contributor to OpenStack Block Storage and Shared File Systems projects. Prior to OpenStack, he has worked on several projects involving data protection across storage systems. Aside from his code contributions, Goutham spends a lot of his time building cross project synchronization and advocating for user experience and API stability. He is the API working group liaison for the Shared File Systems project.)*

* **Rodrigo Barbieri** *(Rodrigo is a core reviewer in Manila since Mitaka release, driver developer for Hitachi since Juno release, and a researcher in the field of Fault Tolerance. He is focused on Manila upstream development and has contributed with several new major features, notably Share Migration and Data Service. He started working with OpenStack in Juno release by deploying OpenStack distributions and developing Hitachi storage device drivers for Cinder and Manila projects.    )*

* **Alex Meade** *(Alex has been developing across various projects in OpenStack since the Cactus release in 2011. Alex has a wide breadth of OpenStack experience having been a top commiter in Nova, a core member of Glance, and key operator of the Rackspace Public Cloud. Currently, he focuses on solidifying Cinder and Manila as enterprise ready projects.)*

* **Tom Barron** *(Tom works on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform storage team, contributing primarily to the Manila and Cinder projects.  He started late in the Juno release, working at first on NetApp Cinder drivers, and then moving on to work on core Cinder code, especially the Cinder backup service.  He is now quite involved with Manila and has developed a keen environment in overlaps and common problems between projects. He has worked as a developer and as a deployer of a variety of storage and network technologies over the course of his career and really enjoys the chance to apply this experience working on open source, especially a project with the reach and impact that OpenStack has.)*

* **Sumit  Kumar** *(Sumit earned his bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech in May 2015. He then joined NetApp as a Technical Marketing Engineer, and has been involved with OpenStack since. He has been an active participant in various Openstack meetups, and has presented sessions on various topics on Openstack forums. He is very excited about the future and potential of OpenStack, and looks forward to contributing to the OpenStack community.)*
