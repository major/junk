Kerberos and Health Checks and Bare Metal, Oh My! Updates to OpenStack Sahara in Newton.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Data Processing service (Sahara) has been a part of OpenStack for quite a while. With the development of highly-anticipated features including bare metal cluster provisioning, Sahara is more ready than ever to unlock the promise of truly elastic data processing. We will discuss new features in Newton, including: Bare Metal cluster provisioning with Ironic Clusters security management with Kerberos integration Cluster management improvements including event logging and cluster health checks Streamlined image generation capabilities New approach to integration testing with a specifically designed testing framework
