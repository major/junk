Understanding Keystone Federation using K2K
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Let’s take a deep dive K2K federation to learn more about keystone’s federation support. Keystone2Keystone federation is a feature of keystone that allows keystone to be run as both an identity provider and a service provider in a federation. First introduced in the Juno release it has been updated and improved in all releases since. K2K allows us to experiment with keystone’s federation support without having to mess with overly complicated identity providers. This talk will dive deep into the technical details of setting up a small K2K federation using the Mitaka release. Most of the setup will be done through the command-line interface. We’ll be discussing each command and its significance as we go. We’ll also be configuring non-OpenStack software, like Apache. Along the way you’ll hear about core federation concepts, like mapping, and how they may apply to federating to external identity providers.
