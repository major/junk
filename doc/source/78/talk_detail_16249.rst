Achieving Zen-like Bliss With Glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Everyone uses Glance, but not everyone uses Glance. Uploading VM disks or data assets has always been the most commonly used feature of Glance. In this talk, we will explore features that extend beyond image upload -- features that operators can use to secure and improve the performance of their Glance deployment, as well as features operators can use to enable their end users toward better collaboration and discovery of data assets. In general, we will answer: How do I discover disk images ? How do I share images effectively with my organization ? How do I ensure the authenticity of image data using digital signatures ? How can I improve the performance of glance image uploads/downloads ? How can I make better use of my image metadata using property protections? What are image locations, and how can I tell if they’re appropriate for my cloud? And more..
