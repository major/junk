Chaos and Order: the user experience is king
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

An important aspect of enterprise ready is to enhance the user experience, CLI is the first channel for outside users interacting with OpenStack, that impact the user experience directly. Currently each service has offered thier own CLI application, but the project specific CLIs creates a horrible user experience for those trying to interact with the CLI as one have to continuously switching between different formatting, command structures, capabilities and requires a deep knowledge of which service is responsible for different tasks, this leads to high technical threshold and poor user experience. OpenStackClient project appears on the right path, it provide OpenStack users with a consistent, simple and predictable CLI user experience, reduce the complexity of OpenStack interaction. Topics discussed the issues encountered in OpenStack operation by using project specific CLI, as well as mission of OpenStackClient project, current ecological communities and the future plan.
