Challenges in operationalizing OpenStack and NFV in the Telco Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Virtualization has often been considered obstinate, proprietary, and costly. To address these concerns, diverse  industries have come together to create an open source virtualization platform for the telecommunication industry.   Cloud computing drives new directions for open source software. Combining OpenStack and 3GPP telecommunications standards to create a framework for increased open source development, collaboration, and innovation. This shift in ideology presents a lot of challenges in the framework that telecommunications companies have been using for years.   In this presentation we will introduce you to some of the challenges, lessons learned, and our hybrid approach to designing the telecommunications framework of tomorrow.
