Heavy Reading Research Study on Telcos'  Plans for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is quickly gaining momentum in the telecom environment--most notably as part of NFV and cloud-led transformation. Heavy Reading, in conjunction with the OpenStack Foundation, surveyed telecom operators from around the world regarding their engagement with OpenStack, their intentions to leverage OpenStack software and the importance of OpenStack to their success in NFV and cloud. In this session, we will discuss the key findings of the study, along with the implications for the OpenStack project and the telecom industry.

This includes particular emphasis on trends such as virtualization, disaggregation and convergence. Trends that I monitor on an on-going basis include how open source is impacting the development process for telecom, and how telco data centers are transforming to support SDN, NFV and cloud.Â )*
