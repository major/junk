NTT West - Beyond Neutron, taking control of a physical multi-vendor network with OpenDaylight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron provides a rich set of functionality to deliver fully featured networking services between OpenStack tenants. However the roles and responsibilities of Neutron end here, to deliver broader networking capabilities and take programmatic control of the underlying network an SDN controller is of value. OpenDaylight is a popular SDN controller, it provides multiple southbound APIs and a model driven abstraction layer allowing systematic programmability of multi-vendor devices. Current efforts to integrate OpenDaylight into an OpenStack environment have focused on simply delivering the same functionality as Neutron. In this presentation we will demonstrate how OpenDaylight can be used to configure underlay network elements such as a firewall and expose this ability as a service for OpenStack tenants to take advantage of, essentially allowing physical FWaaS.
