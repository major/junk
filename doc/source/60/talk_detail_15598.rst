A Scalable Architecture for UHD Video on Demand and Live Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Video on Demand traffic will dominate the Internet load by far in the upcoming years.UHD (4k) video delivery requires massive scale out of video transcoding and caching facilities to impede network congestion and control quality of service.NFV orchestration and Openstack based virtualization can provide a manageable andscalable solution to bridge the "content gap" between the owners of hi-resolutioncontent and the owners of 4k TV sets.
