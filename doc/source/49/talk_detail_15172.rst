Hands-On: Orchestrating Container-based Services in the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Leveraging orchestrated services can be a huge time and productivity saver for your cloud users.  The process of configuring and preparing the resources for those services, however, can be complex and intimidating. OpenStack has several projects for orchestrating services (Heat) and for managing containers (Magnum) that can help you take the sting out of automated deployments.  Join us to get some hands-on time using Magnum and Heat together to create some basic container-based services that you can then expand to fit your specific needs for your own environment.
