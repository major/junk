Pirates of the OpenStack Alley: How to protect your application via neutron extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are security groups adequate for protecting your application ? What can be done to ensure that your deployed application (in form of VMs or Vapp or Stack) is protected within and across data centers/sites? Here comes Firewall-as-a-service and Virtual-private-network-as-a-service (both of which are neutron extensions) to your rescue!  The Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS) provides the ability to assign network-level port security for all traffic entering and exiting a tenant network. The Virtual-Private-Network-as-a-Service (VPNaaS) extension enables OpenStack tenants to extend private networks across the public telecommunication infrastructure. We will have a hands-on session which will help you gain knowledge on how to use and setup FWaaS and VPNaaS in OpenStack .
