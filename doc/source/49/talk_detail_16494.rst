Interconnecting OpenStack based containerized workloads with legacy using HEAT templates.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will be providing hands on lab which will cover spawning KVM based VM's and nova/docker containers all in the same cluster interconnected together with opensource neutron solution. The labs will cover step by step instructions on how to launch a multi-tier application with one tier containerized and other implemented in VM's. It'll also cover a packet walk through of how traffic flows between VM's and docker containers. Further we will demostrate how such multi-tier application can be orchestrated by HEAT templates and in the process we will cover some nifty debugging tips and tricks.
