Barbican Workshop - Securing the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Security is at, or near, the top of everyone's list of "stuff that's important," yet the management of security artifacts (such as keys and certificates) has been lacking a cohesive solution.  This is where Barbican comes into the picture.  Barbican provides secure storage and provisioning of secrets, including keys and certificates.  This workshop provides a tour through the magical world of Barbican, led by core members of the Barbican project. By the end of the class you will know: Importance of secret storage How to store and retrieve secrets with Barbican How to submit an order with Barbican How to create a container How to use quotas Uses for additional user metadata Dogtag Certificate System Integration Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) Device Integration Hardware Security Module (HSM) Setup Performance Barbican Dev-Ops Architecture Use cases for Barbican / Examples Castellan (Generic Key Management Interface) Use Cases Barbican's Roadmap
