Installing Watcher and demo of a Watcher optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Watcher is an open source software package which provides a flexible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds. Watcher provides a complete optimization loop—including everything from a metrics receiver, optimization processor and an action plan applier. This provides a robust framework to realize a wide range of cloud optimization goals, including the reduction of data center operating costs, increased system performance via intelligent virtual machine migration, increased energy efficiency, etc.


* **David TARDIVEL** *(David is senior software engineer in the Cloud Computing Lab @ b-com. and he is one of the original implementers of Watcher, the Resources Optimization framework for OpenStack. The bcom Institute of Research & Technology is dedicated to boost development and marketing of tools, products and services that improve everyday’s life, thanks to research and innovation in digital technologies. In concrete terms, bcom  innovates at the highest level in the areas of hypermedia (ultra high definition images, 3D sound and images, intelligent content, virtual and augmented reality, etc.), smarter and faster networks and e-health as the first area of application. It is based in Rennes, France and was launched at the end of 2012. It is supported by French government, Brittany Region and Cities Councils.    )*

* **Vincent FRANCOISE** *(Vincent is a software engineer that has been working on Watcher to eventually become one of its core contributor. Ever since, he's been heavily committed to this project. )*

* **Gang Zhai** *(Gang joined Intel in 2003 as kernel engineer for driver development. From 2005, Gang switched to open source virtualization, like xen/kvm, with interests in VT enabling, live migration, GPU virtualization. In 2014, joined openstack community and mainly focused on telemetry work.  )*
