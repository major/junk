Learning OpenStack - A Hands-On Guide to Extend and Customize OpenStack Compute Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the industry standard cloud infrastructure. Every OpenStack users are expecting OpenStack can continue to adopt new features. However, as a mature open source project, OpenStack can not expand too much to accommodate many new features. The alternative way is to let OpenStack users to extend and customize OpenStack by themselves. This hands-on workshop will guide audiences to understand the open architecture of OpenStack, and will instruct them to practice developing OpenStack extension code from API layer to driver layer (mostly for Nova and Neutron), in order to implement new capabilities which is not supported by existing OpenStack code, or customizing the behavior of existing OpenStack functionality. Those extension and customization need to be always compatible with latest OpenStack code, so that it can continue to work with newer OpenStack releases. This hands-on workshop will also introduce CI concept and practice to ensure the compatibility of extension code.
