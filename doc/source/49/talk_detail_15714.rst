Advanced Heat: Getting the Most Out of Your Stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Heat is an extremely useful OpenStack service — and one that you're almost certainly not using to its full potential. In this workshop, you'll learn about advanced Heat concepts, and use Heat to the best of its abilities. Among the things you'll learn, we'll include: A refresher on cloud-init, cloud-config and its Heat resource, OS::Heat::CloudConfig — an extraordinarily useful means to configure your VMs right when you boot them OS::Heat::WaitCondition and OS::Heat::WaitConditionHandle — allowing you to streamline the deployment of dependent resources OS::Heat::ResourceGroup — enabling you to define arbitrarily complex resource bundles, and using them as you would any other simple Heat resource These advanced Heat features are highly useful, but badly under-utilized — you should know and use them! In hands-on lab sessions, you'll learn how you'll use these advanced resource types to deploy complex virtual environments quickly and easily, on an OpenStack cluster of your own.
