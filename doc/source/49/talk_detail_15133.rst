Hands-on lab: Integrate cloud platforms on my enterprise...really integrate it!!.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every enterprise is “on the cloud” nowadays, but majority are just consuming the product and not really embedding it on their IT, apps, and processes, The target of the session is to expose different approaches to simplify the consumption of the cloud, embedding it on the enterprise systems and apps, creating “smart applications” and “smart processes” that simplifies the flow of cloud consumption, using cloud APIs and monitoring tools. The hands-on lab will guide along the way to integrate a ERP (ODOO) with OpenStack keeping track of the "cloud" assets
