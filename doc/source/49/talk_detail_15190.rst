Keystone in the Real World: A Hands-On Workshop with Keystone v3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Now that more organizations are upgrading to the Keystone v3 API, how can we use it to setup a real-world, multi-domain OpenStack environment?  Join us in this hands-on interactive workshop as we walk through a live install and configuration of Keystone v3.  Participants will not only learn the history of the Keystone project but receive access to a live OpenStack environment where they will complete the challenge of setting up Keystone for a real-world organization.  Learn the proper way to create domains for business units while ensuring your domain and projects admins only have access to their assigned areas.  Create custom roles and apply those roles to groups that span multiple business units and projects.  Go beyond creating a simple Keystone deployments and step into Keystone in the Real World!
