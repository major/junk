Building a Heat Template from the Ground Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will teach you to build a OpenStack Heat template from the ground up. The traditional approach to learning Heat usually involves setting up WordPress or another application through a Heat template. This lab is different. Namely, there will be no application at the end of it, just a VM with "Hello, world" in its message of the day. This gives us the luxury of focussing on what comes before the user-data script that deploys WordPress. The aim of this lab is a more basic understanding of two things: First, the building blocks and infrastructure an OpenStack based setup of one or more servers consists of: virtual machines, virtual networks and floating IP addresses, to name but a few. Second, it will teach participants how to describe all of these building blocks reproducibly in terms of a Heat template. This Heat template will be assembled step by step, with debugging practice for various common errors along the way.
