Getting Started With OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the de facto standard for private Clouds. But how can someone quickly get started? This workshop will walk participants through an overview of the history and governance model of the poject, followed by a hands-on tour of the most deployed OpenStack components. As part of this workshop, we will assist attendees with deploying a test OpenStack instance on their laptops using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and RDO. (The relevant Vagrant file and pre-workshop instructions can be found below.) We will then walk attendees through the horizon dashboard and the OpenStack CLI to manage and use their new OpenStack instance. ---------------------------------------------------- Before you arrive at this session please complete the "Preparation" section of these instructions: https://radez.fedorapeople.org/GettingStartedWithOpenStack.html  It will take some time and bandwidth, please plan accordingly.
