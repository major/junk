Get started with the OpenStack REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot of people out there are using OpenStack in some way, not as many have been interacting with OpenStack from their own application - but a lot of these people would gain a lot of the possibility to do so. The goal with this session is to do an introduction to the OpenStack REST APIs and end up with a created server in an OpenStack public cloud - completely via the REST API. Python is the most used programming language around OpenStack, but to make this more common for the regular web developer, this session will use PHP, HTML and JavaScript. This session is both a guide to get started with the API, as well as a "hands on lab" - you can follow along and create your own scripts during the session.
