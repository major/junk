Hands-on Lab: Test Drive your OpenStack Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron is deployed in the majority of OpenStack clouds but it still constitutes one of the key areas of concerns for organizations worldwide. The transition from traditional hardware-centric networking to the software defined model takes time and learning and requires a mental shift as well as a change in workflows, procedures, tools and best-practices. In this session each participant will be provided with a personal sandbox OpenStack running a live Liberty-based environment and will work on common use cases and applications of SDNs in an OpenStack Cloud. The class will focus on test cases that will move beyond the basics of L2 and L3 and deploy VNFs such as NAT and security policies on top of a 3-tier application topology. The class will also go through exercises that are focused on monitoring and troubleshooting SDNs in an OpenStack cloud.
