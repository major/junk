Hands on training in enhancing openstack HEAT and Ceilometer for TELCO use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As we already know Telcos are moving further along in embracing Openstack inorder to build next generation Telco cloud offerings and one of the main pillar around this is Network Functions Virtualization or NFV. One of the key aspect of rolling out a effective NFV based offering is agility. Agility manifests in the form of template driven orchestration of the the network function and how the network functions can  scale UP or DOWN based on the changing parameters or threshold. In this session we are going to demonstrate and guide the participants through a hands on lab leveraging Openstack Neutron  , Openstack HEAT , Openstack Ceilometer and their respective extensions.
