Branding Horizon: A Guide to Customize All The Things!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the theming architecture now available in Horizon, customizing the look and feel is now easier than it has ever been.  Although the base user interface of Horizon is perfectly usable, most of the companies that deploy Horizon for enterprise purposes seek to reband and customize many aspects of the current UI.  In the past, this has been possible, but only through the burden of maintaining many patches and a spaghetti mess of CSS specificity.  This tends to be less than ideal, as it makes it difficult for branding customizations to survive between releases and ever evolving code.
