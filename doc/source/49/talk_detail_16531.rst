Make Me a MidoNet Master: Hands-On Workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

MidoNet is a popular Neutron plugin for large scale OpenStack clouds (1000+ cores). MidoNet is an open source network platform that can be used to build arbitrary network topologies on top of existing IP networks without having to modify the underlying infrastructure. Today, the most common use case for MidoNet is with OpenStack deployments. You do not need special hardware for using MidoNet, as it is all based on software. Come and learn from the engineers that contribute to the Neutron and Kuryr projects! This hands-on workshop will provide the know-how for participants to install MidoNet themselves using Ansible, walk-through an environment to learn MidoNet components, configure various network topologies including load-balancers, firewalls, security groups, & advanced networking, and finally implement best practices and troubleshooting skills.
