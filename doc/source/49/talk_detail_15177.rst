Secure Your Cinder: A Hands-On Workshop with Cinder Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We all know Cinder provides the awesome ability to attach block storage to our Nova instances but how secure is the data we place on these volumes? Join us as we explore the potential security vulnerabilities in using unencrypted Cinder storage and setup a live OpenStack environment to utilize block device level encryption.  Participants will learn the history of Linux encryption methods and how Cinder can utilize these methods to securely write data to block volumes.  All participants will receive a live OpenStack environment and step-by-step instruction on the Linux packages and OpenStack configuration files necessary to implement a secure Cinder infrastructure.  After completing the workshop,  participants walk away with peace of mind when faced with the possibility of bare-metal attacks on their OpenStack environment!
