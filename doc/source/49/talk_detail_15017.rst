OVN based OpenStack Cloud Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying OpenStack cloud is not an easy task. It is especially difficult when you are new to OpenStack. There are so many configuration parameters and plugins that you can choose from when you deploy OpenStack cloud. These parameters and plugins make OpenStack cloud very flexible and full of possibilities, but for a new OpenStack developer or a cloud administrator, It creates a steep learning curve, when it comes to OpenStack Neutron, that difficulties just jump to a whole new level. In this hands-on workshop, I will introduce a simple bash script based vagrant project and show you how you can easily deploy an OpenStack cloud onto either virtual machines or physical machines. I will use the OVN plugin as an example. If you like to experience different neutron plugins such as LinuxBridge, OVS, you can simply change one flag in this project configuration file, you will have an OpenStack cloud with your chosen neutron plugin.
