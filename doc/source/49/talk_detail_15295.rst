Getting Started with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hearing a lot about OpenStack and want to check it out for yourself? See how quick and easy it is to install and start using OpenStack using containers running within a VM on your own laptop. Acquaint yourself with the environment. Learn your way around Horizon (GUI) and the CLI to view and operate an OpenStack cloud, both from the perspective of a cloud administrator and as a tenant/user of the cloud. See how to automate typical workflows such as deploying a new multi-tier application. Best of all, take what you learn with you and experiment on your own to discover all OpenStack offers you.

His journey with open source began in 1999 as a founding member of Vovida Networks where he developed some of the industry's first open source Voice over IP (VoIP) protocol stacks and applications. Now at Cisco, Charles has become a recognized champion of open standards, open source, and interoperability. He runs the Open Source Dev Center, which focuses on Cisco’s major open source contributions, use, and community engagements, including OpenStack, OpenDaylight, and OPNFV. Last year, he successfully introduced open source hackathons into IETF and MEF, revolutionizing the way these SDOs operate and uniting open source software with open standards to maximize the pace and relevance of both. Charles speaks regularly at CiscoLive and has also been a speaker at previous OpenStack, RedHat, LinuxCon, and MPLS SDN NFV World Congress events.)*
