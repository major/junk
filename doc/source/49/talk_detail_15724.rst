Don’t get burned! :  Playing with fire (Aodh) and Heat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Creating your virtual application is just the first step in supporting it.  How do you make sure that nothing goes wrong?  What can you do to prevent it from crashing and burning? One solution is to monitor/manage your application by using Aodh and Heat together to set up alarms and react to them automatically.  This lab will give you *HANDS ON* experience with setting up alarms via Aodh and then triggering responses specified via Heat templates. Don’t get caught unaware!  Come to this session and learn how to FIREPROOF your applications.
