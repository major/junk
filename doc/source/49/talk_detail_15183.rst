Autoscale 101: A Hands-On Workshop with Heat & Ceilometer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Although Autoscaling has certainly been one of the buzziest buzzwords, what's the real magic that makes it all work?  Join us as we setup OpenStack autoscaling with the help of the Heat and Ceilometer services.  This workshop provides an easy-to-understand introduction to autoscaling in OpenStack by not only presenting a fun look at the history of the feature, but a step-by-step walkthrough on how to setup your very own autoscaling application!  Learn how to prepare your application for world-wide popularity as demand begins to spike and decrease your capacity during those less busy times!
