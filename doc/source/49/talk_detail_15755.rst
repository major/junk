Deploying Magnum with OpenStack Ansible, Hands-On Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud users are excited about using container tools to simplify and accelerate the deployment and management of applications. Magnum brings leading container platforms to OpenStack. In this lab you will install and configure OpenStack Magnum using OpenStack Ansible (OSA). Learn how OSA simplifies maintenance of cloud infrastructure and how Magnum makes it easy for your users to launch Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Apache Mesos clusters. We will focus on:* OpenStack Ansible architecture* OpenStack Magnum architecture* Installation of a new service (Magnum) into an existing OSA cloud* Configuration of Magnum* Creation of a Kubernetes/Swarm/Mesos cluster* Pitfalls encountered during operation of an OSA cloud
