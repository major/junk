Neutron Ninja 101: A Hands-On Workshop with Neutron Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Heard Neutron is super powerful but finding it too confusing to really understand?  In this hands-on workshop, participants will take a fun, easily accessible journey through Neutron and how it relates to real-world networking basics.  Each participant will gain hands-on Neutron experience by receiving credentials to a live OpenStack environment!  By the end of this hands-on workshop, participants will not only know how to create networks, subnets, routers, floating ips, and security groups, but truly understand the magic taking place behind the scenes that make all of it a reality!  No prior OpenStack experience is necessary!
