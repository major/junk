==============================================================


Architectural Decisions
-----------------------


"Do I need a Cloud Management Platform to manage OpenStack? "
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We often find that day two operations in OpenStack can be very painful, and a Cloud Management Platform (CMP) can help with this. A CMP can easily manage monitoring, insights, security or compliance, as well as basic chargeback. During this session we will do a live demonstration to illustrate the benefits of a CMP.

In 2010 he changed his area to Cloud environments and he has been collaborating in the design and architecture on several Private and Public clouds working with a System Integrator, and got involved in different projects, one of them was OpenStack. Since then, he tried to integrate OpenStack with the existing technologies as well to understand how OpenStack fits in the current Customer's ecosystem as an Architect In 2014 he joined Canonical to expand the architecture of their products and add his expertise to the business, as well as complex architecture's integration experiences By the end of 2015 he left Canonical but he is still interested on OpenStack and following the community very closely)*


A Nova Scheduler for Public Cloud Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the advent of Nova Cells v2, the need for high throughput VM scheduling is becoming increasingly critical to the operation of OpenStack at public cloud scale.  For Cells v2, in particular, the requirement to use a global scheduler means that the scheduler must be able to manage more hypervisors and, potentially, many more VMs.  As with all things cloud, horizontal scaling seems like a natural solution.  However, in the case of the Caching Scheduler, for instance, more schedulers means more resource contention which often results in the infamous "No Valid Host" error.We present performance results for multiple scheduler implementations in an attempt to identify the best one to resolve the resource contention problems, and subsequent throughput deficiencies, encountered in distributed scheduling. One such implementation makes novel use of Redis as a remote, in-memory DB in place of the usual Nova DB.

A Simple Way to Backup and Restore OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Backup and Restore is important for OpenStack users to keep their data safe. It is an essential function for most of the enterprises using OpenStack. But most users don’t know that backup and restore is easy to achieve in OpenStack. This session presents how to simply backup and restore the cloud and shows some experiences with a use case. OpenStack is friendly to backup and restore operations. Databases and configurations are two main parts to be backed up and restored. We have designed a simple way to backup and restore the controller plane of Openstack. Nova, Glance, Keystone, Horizon, Cinder, Neutron, Heat and Ceilometer are included in the scope. The method was implemented in IBM Cloud Manager, which is a cloud solution based on Openstack and released to clients.

Analyzing and Managing Performance Issues on Real-Time OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As we presented at the last OpenStack Summit in Austin, we shared how to build real-time cloud using OpenStack, proposing a reference architecture. And now it seems that more users and operators need to run low-latency or real-time applications (such as audio/video streaming, highly interactive systems, IoT, HPC, etc.) to meet their requirements in clouds.   This time we we share how to analyze and manage performance issues that users or operators can encounter, showing a framework on performance monitoring.  Since we are working on Real-time KVM as one of the projects of KVM enhancements for NFV at OPNFV, we share our know-how and experiences to root-cause performance or real-time issues on OpenStack. We use more common cases to make the presentation comprehensive and generic. Typical NFV workloads push the limits in all of the system resource areas: CPU, I/O, and memory, and our our know-how and experiences should be applicable to common cases.

Architecting An Enterprise-Grade Cloud Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most enterprises don't plan for Multi-Cloud, Multi-Cloud organically happens as one departement deploys OpenStack and another adopts a public cloud. Finding a balance between the needs of multiple enterprise consituencies while leveraging the benefits of a Multi-Cloud environment is proving to be a challege. This talk will explore the "Enterprise-Grade Cloud Stack" and will provide an overview on how today's enterprises approach a Multi-Cloud strategy, what role does OpenStack play, and what are the types of tools that are available to tackle some of the common challenges.

Architectural considerations for big data workloads on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data intensive big data applications such as Kafka, Hadoop, and NoSQL are increasingly common in the modern data center, and now more than ever are being deployed at scale in OpenStack cloud environments. The performance demands placed on cloud infrastructure can be extreme, and in shared environment can often result in resource contention or outright stravation. This requires cloud infrastructure architected to support the diverse sets of requirements of these applications. In this talk we discuss considerations and approaches for handling the requirements of data intensive big data workloads in OpenStack such as: Defining big data workload applications proflies Architecting for high performance workloads Synthetic workload and full stack application testing

Architectural Design considerations for Openstack planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Design an Openstack Cloud infrastructure is not a trivial task. There are so many variables to be considered that your choices must be cautiously made. Meet workloads/cloud users expectations should be the ultimate goal, while minimally considering high-availability, resiliency, robustness, application response time, latency, and overall performance. According to April's Openstack User Survey, the top 3 workloads for production environment are comprised of Software dev/test/QA and CI (44%), Infrastructure services (35%), and Web Services and e-commerce (29%). We will use a new open testing framework that we have developed to run on top of IaaS Business Critical Applications. We will explain how some choices can impact your Openstack Cloud infrastructure. We will walk you through our latest findings with regards to: * Different processors generations, and impacts on overall infrastructure * CEPH performance (Comparing HDDs and SSDs) * Memory, Network and Application level metrics

Are Reference Implementations Fashionable?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The problem for new adopters / seekers of OpenStack is that they are not sure where to start and how to start, leave alone appreciating where OpenStack can help them.  In this session we share our findings from user surveys on typical deployment sizes and their usages and the reference implementations born from them. The fact that telcos / enterprises range from ~$100 M to $ 100 B and beyond, the appetite for OpenStack adoption falls across huge spectrum. So are the use cases, users, and preferences of projects / tools based on more sensitive business parameters and not necessarily on the basis of technical appropriateness. The reference implementations are a step in this direction to enable enterprises to jump start on OpenStack, in a fast, reliable, effective, and efficient manner. We next present our work on one such “packaged” implementation, a wizard driven cloud deployment that installs reference implementations on enterprise-grade servers and developer NUCs, alike.

Autoscale your PaaS with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container management platforms like OpenShift bring a new level of scalability and flexibility to application development teams. OpenShift provides auto-scaling and elasticity to the containerized applications running on the platform by leveraging Docker and Kubernetes natively. However, what happens when the application demand exceeds the capacity of the platform itself? OpenShift does not currently auto-scale the underlying platform. But OpenStack offers a flexible, capable Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering to complement your Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Attendees will see a demonstration of the use of OpenStack as an IaaS to automatically scale OpenShift nodes based on application demand running on top of OpenShift PaaS. They should walk away with a fundamental understanding of how to use this type of solution in their own environments.

Baremetal to Openstack on Kubernetes from 0 to 100
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Imagine you have 13 data centers. Each with a rack of completely blank servers. You have a small but strong, cross-functional team. Your misson, if you choose to accept it, is to deploy and operate an Openstack installation in each data center. What would you do? We chose to drink the kool aid and use Kubernetes and Kolla to manage the Openstack deployments. CoreOS as the underlying operating system promises to minimise operational burden. Bootstrapping this setup in an automated fashion revealed a unique set of challenges that we would like to share. This talk showcases SAP's approach to combine Kolla, Kubernetes and CoreOS into a control plane for an Openstack based private cloud. We will explore how to automatically bootstrap a multi-regional, containerised Openstack from bare metal. A demonstration of our continuous delivery workflow and tools will give you deep hands-on insight. In closing we will discuss pain points and problems we encountered in using a containerised Openstack.

Best Practices for Database as a Service with Trove: Changing the Paradigm for OpenStack Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises large and small find that the success of their cloud depends on bringing applications to the cloud. It is generally easier to migrate stateless workloads to the cloud, and it is often the case that working with database workloads is a major stumbling point to cloud adoption. This is also compounded by the wide variety of databases that enterprises employ. Even in the cloud, a number of users still deploy database software into virtual machines and containers using some home-grown orchestration but this increasingly has become a pain point. This talk describes how DBaaS using OpenStack Trove can fundamentally change the paradigm for databases in the cloud, and how it can considerably ease the pain in database consumption in the enterprise. Looking ahead, we see an evolution of DBaaS to encompass not just the existing SQL and NoSQL databases but also big-data solutions, and a data pipeline that will provide users with a unified data management platform for the enterprise.

Big Brother is watching you! Or how to audit the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operating big public clouds opens a wide stack of challenges and security requirements to architects, cloud operators and all members of public cloud vendor team. Each user step should be verified and tracked to avoid intrusions or/and to have a chance to identify actions sequence that may have caused some issue or led to an unpredictable situation. A cloud audit enables you to monitor who, when, where, why and how actions were taken in the cloud environment. In this presentation we will describe our experience of implementing a CADF based audit, and overview cloud performance measurements, the decisions we made and which solutions we had to reject and why.

Big Data - big deal?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Big Data and Cloud: two of the main overarching topics in enterprise IT this summer. Both have one thing in common - there are a few ways to get it right and more ways to get it wrong. Put both together and you can do amazing things - or fall of a very tall cliff. We are currently working on a number of concurrent Big Data projects, both with Big Data as a service in form of Sahara, and with other Big Data deployment approaches. In this session we will discuss our experiences with these projects and the architectural work we've done around the various Hadoop distributions, which we have carefully distilled into a delicious blend of applicable information with hints of theory and stories from the trenches. As a team we are going to present the current state of affairs of Big Data in the cloud, approaches to get a Big Data project right and caveats to avoid falling into common traps.

Boosting OpenStack Performance by using PyPy JIT as the default Python interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we will demonstrate how to improve OpenStack performance by making PyPy JIT (Just-In-Time) as the default Python interpreter with no application code changes. We conducted a proof-of-concept study using PyPy JIT on five core components, Keystone, Nova, Neutron, Glance and Cinder.  Our result indicates performance gain by up to 35%, and often non-interpreter related bottlenecks are exposed after PyPy JIT is used, painting a bright picture for a wider adoption of PyPy JIT in all OpenStack components.  In addition, we will also explain how to experiment with PyPy JIT and share some of the issues and experience we have gained in the adoption process.  This talk is a continuation of a previous talk by Dave Stewart/John Dickson titled “Doubling Performance in Swift with No Code Changes” and presented in the OpenStack Summit Austin 2016, in which up to 111% gain was demonstrated on OpenStack Swift   .  .

Building a media transcoding pipeline on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session presents an architecture on how to build a media transcoding pipeline on OpenStack.  The explosion of end-user devices (laptop, phone, set-top boxes, etc) is changing the media presentation landscape and requiring content providers to transcode a media to various formats, resolution, bitrate, etc. Media transcoding demands high CPU and large storage resources in general, but those themselves don’t necessarily provide effective solutions. In this session, we will share the reference architecture of deploying such workload and show how to utilize various OpenStack components to fulfil the media transcoding requirements. We will share our experiences, knowledge and best practices including how to configure OpenStack settings, such as nova (CPU, flavor, ephemeral disk), glance and swift. We will also present a performance benchmark results of running the transcoding tasks on different settings.

Building a private cloud with Openstack and Nuage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In 2013 Santander committed to embrace private cloud in an effort to improve IT delivery lead times and consolidate infrastructure resources in line with the company's devops adoption strategy.

Building Data Centers of the Future with OpenStack and Composable Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The datacenters of the future will leverage disaggregated hardware with software that enables dynamic programmatic composition, control, and management. The cloud infrastructure can expand and shrink to meet transient demands from workloads, in addition to the hosts themselves being repurposed to closely match the workload requirements. Intel Rack Scale Design (RSD) takes us closer to that vision, implementing the DMTF Redfish API and extending upon it. The Plasma project in OpenStack has been created to integrate Rack Scale Design with Nova and Ironic to dynamically add and release resources as necessary to meet workload demands. Lenovo is developing new hardware management capabilities and pluggable interfaces to support RSD and Plasma. We will present the architecture of RSD and the design of Lenovo’s systems management software layer and APIs for OpenStack RSD plug-ins.

Clustered File Systems in Your Application Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has mature and powerful support for block storage devices. Allowing solutions architects to easily house traditional local file systems for data storage. A busy cloud application at scale needs horizontal scalability and High Availability for all of the layers in the stack. This means Catalyst has been deploying a range of clustered file system solutions inside cloud platforms since 2012. Catalyst have had exposture with NFS, OCFS2, DRBD, CEPH and GlusterFS. We will talk about our experiences here, especially with GlusterFS usage in anger. In this presentation we will talk about the journey we are still on in finding the best fit for a file system inside a large fully-orchestrated cloud application stack. We'll also socialising some mistakes that we think people making when choosing a file storage solution and remind everyone why clustered/networked file systems are a bit of a pain and why it makes sense to start thinking about object storage for more and more use cases.

Cockpit and OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Some organizations need server admin interfaces for diverse reasons, currently there are lots of options but they all need some level of configuration, are too complex and/or use a considerable amount of resources. Cockpit is an interactive server admin interface. It comes “out of the box” ready for the admin to interact with the system immediately. It can manage multiple servers from a central interface with very little effort. Cockpit is a good choice for managing OpenStack nodes since it has nearly zero footprint, it starts on demand via socket activation and exits when not in use, leaving more system resources available for the OpenStack services. In this talk we'll address a proof of concept OpenStack multinode installation using Cockpit as the bare metal admin interface and compare its resource use with a TripleO installation.

Control Plane Architectures: Design Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building an OpenStack private cloud can be very complex.  Underpinning the entire operational capabilities of your cloud is the Control Plane.  It's common knowledge you should treat your cloud resources "like cattle" and not "pets", yet most clouds treat the control plane like a favored pet. How should the modern cloud architect choose to design the control plane aspect of your private cloud?

Controlling access to OpenStack in the Enterprise, this is not a public cloud!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Addressing access control in the enterprise is a hugh challange, as a cloud architect and cloud operator we need to take into account the complexities of exisiting enterprise authentication standards and requirements. The maturity of Openstack authentication mechanisms allows for limited controls and auditing that often dont meet the percieved needs of the enterprise.  We will discussion the short falls and challenges that exisit in Openstack today and what is being done to through blueprints and proposed patches to remedy the situation  Finally we will present a possible solution to the problem, and include a demo of a working RBAC solution for the enterprise.

Decomposing a monolithic architecture through common frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides a monolithic canvas to build the cloud of your dreams.  Building the "Art of the Possible" can disable even the best architect. Development of rapid, modular and fluid IT demands more from infrastructure through the application layer. Decomposing the architecture and align it with common frameworks built in small appliance-like blocks requires enterprise architectures need to be more flexible and liquid, forcing architects and engineers to think on designs that are more appliance driven. This session is designed to be a deep dive into containerization of the entire cloud infrastructure and application layer. We will look at the technical considerations, review tradeoffs and look at an example environment that has various levels of simplified blocks to enable snap-on like Lego Blocks.

Deploying and Operating Trove in Production: Reference Architectures and considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Trove allows users to provision and manage the lifecycle of over a dozen relational and NoSQL databases. This talk provides a detailed description of the OpenStack Trove architecture, and common reference architectures for deploying Trove. Trove's architecture is very similar to other OpenStack services in that it has a number of control plane components (API, Task Manager, Conductor), but is different from other services in that it has a guest agent that runs in the guest instance; an instance that runs in tenant context. Proper configuration is therefore crucial to stable and secure operation of Trove. This talk begins with a detailed description of the architecture of Trove, the control plane components and the components that run in the guest instances. It describes the various steps that typically must be performed in installing Trove, and how the various components interact with each other.

Deploying and optimizing for cloud storage systems using Swift simulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the rise of cloud systems, IT spending on the storage system is increasing. In order to minimize costs, architects must optimize system capacities and characteristics. Current capacity planning is mostly based on trial and errors as well as rough resource estimations. With increasing hardware diversity and software stack complexity this approach is not efficient enough. This session presents a novel simulation approach, which can be used before system provisioning for cluster capacity planning, performance evaluation, and optimization. Questions such as how to size the cluster, how to configure the software parameters and how to choose the best hardware components can be answered even before software and hardware components are made available.

Designing  scalable and resilient  OpenStack deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scalable OpenStack cloud deployment isn’t trivial and the unpredictable nature of public cloud workloads adds an extra layer of uncertainty. Enterprise OpenStack cloud deployments are expected to have qualities like high availability, scalability, performance gurantees and security inherent in their architecture.  If you are planning on deploying an OpenStack public cloud, how exactly can you architect your OpenStack components on the underlying infrastructure while maintaining zero down-time, performance guarantees, and tenant isolation at the same time? In this session, we take a peek into some of the specific requirements for OpenStack cloud architecture from our customers leading to some of the architecture design choices. We also discuss how converged infrastructure architecture can meet the above challenges.

Direct Message Routing for Oslo.Messaging  -  Topology and Deployment Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Direct messaging for RPC traffic patterns has emerged as a key requirement for very large scale and highly resilient OpenStack deployments. The use of message brokers for the RPC messaging pattern can be operationally complex due to the state management and clustering techniques required to realize a scalable and resilient control plane. With the OpenStack Newton release, the Oslo.Messaging library now includes support for an easy to setup, highly scalable, distributed and resilient brokerless message bus based on message routing rather than messaging queuing. This direct messaging support for RPC traffic patterns introduces an alternative architecture and with it new  topology and deployment considerations.

Embracing Openstack, the right way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is usually one of the first steps of a company’s IT transformation. This transformation forces the IT departments to move out of their comfort zone and embrace new concepts, new processes, and new technologies. That’s why users don’t simply deploy OpenStack in production and hope that everything will be ok. Using our field experience, Red Hat has developed a consulting model to cover the gaps so we don’t limit ourselves to putting an OpenStack platform in the customer’s premises. Instead, we make sure that the customer can achieve their goal of moving to cloud technologies using OpenStack. In this session we will share our consulting model, along with real examples of bad habits that could make an OpenStack project fail.

On an average day, AT&T is transiting 114 petabytes of data across its network.  This has required that we carefully evaluate how we build and operate our networks especially within our OpenStack environments where NFV deployments are growing rapidly.  Choosing a particular approach has lasting consequences and today there are more OpenStack network architectures and plugins than at any time in the past.   How do you choose an architecture, plugin, and set each of the many tunable parameters correctly for your organization? You’ll learn how we approached systematically comparing, benchmarking, ranking, and stress testing network plugins and architectures available in OpenStack including options such as OpenContrail, DragonFlow, OVS+SFC, and more.  We’ll review the tools we leveraged, and finally discuss our criteria for ultimately selecting the correct strategy for our organization and our complex NFV needs.

Get more juice out of your Cloud - Dynamic Over Provisioning techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In a multi-tenanted Enterprise Cloud deployment, every now and then, we face a situation where we wished we had more compute resource to service new requirements. Since capacity planning is not a fool-proof prediction of your growth, facing a resource crunch situation is inevitable. To mitigate this challenge, in this presentation, we will showcase techniques which you can use to run your cloud at maximum efficiency. We will showcase how to make the entire deployment elastic by innovatively expanding and contracting memory / CPU overcommits without penalising performance.

Glare - a unified binary repository for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Glare (from GLance Artifact REpository) is a new service in the Glance project that provides a secure and customizable unified binary repository for OpenStack. The idea behind Glare is to allow various OpenStack services to catalog different objects they use to operate. Images used by Nova to run the VMs are just the best known examples of such objects; other examples include Heat templates, Tacker blueprints, Murano packages, and so on. Obviously, this functionality is common for different kinds of objects, and is usually unrelated to the primary mission of respective projects using these objects. That's why we implemented a dedicated service that will take care of managing various data assets in OpenStack clouds. The talk will describe how Glare helps to manage different artifacts across the cloud, how you can build your own private and secure catalog with artifacts for your service, what deployers need to know about the installation process, and what is coming in the future.

Global Load Balancing for VNF’s and PaaS in a Largely Distributed Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T is delivering its Network on Demand, by embracing Network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN).  As we learn to incorporate geographic redundancy across the VNF traffic, we quickly run into the lack of GSLB functionality inherently within OpenStack. The Kosmos project approach to GSLB , although promising doesn’t; seem to properly encapsulate the ability to incorporate existing solutions in the market. Organizations might  already be utilizing  an existing GSLB vendor. We need an approach that integrates GSLB seamlessly into the OpenStack ecosystem, and provide a simple mechanisms to integrate with existing solutions. We’ll review the proposed Kosmos architecture, how we leverage it, how we plan to implement the architecture at a regional or local level, and finally discuss our implementation and how it is been utilized to help improve the reliability of  our VNF’s and largely distributed PaaS applications.

Global name space of data between OpenStack, on premise and public cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hybrid cloud environments are real now. Enterprises are no longer sticking to a single cloud, they are opting for a hybrid approach of having a OpenStack private cloud and one or more public clouds. In this session we will showcase the scalable Veritas NAS solution that can manage data present in OpenStack, on premise and other public clouds using a single global namespace.  A single global namespace of OpenStack and on premise data greatly reduces complexities of data management and migration.

Have a bite of 1K+ nodes with a handful of servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One big reason of the challenges brought by deploying OpenStack at large scale (beyond 1K nodes) is that the code is not developed and tested on a deployment at such large scale.  Intel together with SVMSoft China (a joint venture of Sugon and VMware in China) have been seeking a way to provision a large scale cloud with fairly little hardware mainly for product quality assurance purpose. What has been achieved is an agile, lightweight, scalable system which provisions cloud at large scale in containers. This system has been used for ensuring that our products scale well and provides good performance at large scale. This presentation will reveal data in aspects such as container intensity, footprint, optimization and networking. It also has a performance comparison between vanilla neutron and neutron with OpenDaylight as the backend. This system can be used as a CI (Contiguous Integration) system for community.

How best to deliver micro-services and Apps. using Kubernetes and Docker, as an OpenStack operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you and your Organization been evaluating OpenStack to help solve your business use-cases and application needs?  Somewhere along the way Docker and Kubernetes popped up on your horizon, and that got you pondering if you should be leveraging all or some of those options to deliver your apps effectively. If yes - then join us as we walk thru some viable options to enable Kubernetes and Docker to deliver apps. and services for your developers, users and tenants. Engage in a preemptive self-disruption exercise to better understand your OpenStack path going forward, as containers gain prominence. We’ll cover: Should you consider providing K8S clusters as an IaaS feature? Or is letting your cloud tenants  operate their own container layer a better architectural strategy? We’ll also discuss two architectural options:   Option(a) Delivering apps. and services w/ docker on bare metal versus option(b) Leveraging “Container ---> VM --> docker” for running your containerized workloads.

How is Ceilometer/Gnocchi scale out?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The utilization data of the virtual or physical resources are very important in data center operations. Once stored persistently, these data could be retrieved for later analysis, such as metering and billing, and could be used to trigger actions when certain criteria are met, such as alarming, etc.  Ceilometer is the service designed to collect those data, and was complained for not scaling very well in its own data store. Gnocchi is the time-series database designed to solve the scale out issues, by working as the data store backend for Ceilometer. In this presentation, we’ll introduce the evaluation work we’ve done for Ceilometer/Gnocchi on how it scales out in typical configurations.  We’ll also give suggestions on how to configure Ceilometer/Gnocchi to make them perform well.

How OpenStack googlifies the data center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is today’s most widely used and fastest-growing cloud infrastructure technology. It helps build and manage private, public, and hybrid clouds that ensure reliable, scalable, and flexible services – all while reducing operational overhead. But in order to truly succeed, basing all the data center parts in software is essential or at least highly beneficial. Behind this thought is the googlification of the data center: running software on commodity hardware allows for massive increases in utilization and leads to a significant drop in operations overhead. Based on the Google and Amazon role model, Felix will give an outline of said evolution and claim that OpenStack is a major driving force in the process but is only complete when making good on the ”software-defined“ promise.

Identity Management at Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the Openstack community continues to innovate its architecture at a large enterprise scale, Keystone as an Identity Manager is lagging behind.  Multi-cloud and multi-region architectures often have a need for synchronizing both full or partial identities and assignments across sites. This session aims to highlight various identity architectures based on the typical integration requirements of an enterprise environment. Such architectures include integrating with Active Directory, integrating with an Identity Provider, and synchronizing multi-site Keystone identities. Keystone also suffers from the lack of auditing and reporting capabilities, a requirement highly important at large scale. The second portion of this talk aims to introduce Midpoint (OSS covered under the apache 2.0 open source license) as an alternative identity manager behind the scenes, and showcase how a comprehensive identity management solution can address the challenges that Keystone currently fails to address.

The technologies can get rid of some pain points that operators hit in their operations (e.g. deploy, upgrade and failover) and make it simple to manage systems. OpenStack is also one of the software products, so cloud operators would like to get the benefit using containers to deploy OpenStack. However, there are several options for container technology and also for container orchestration technology. That makes the operators harder to choose which they should use. This talk presents a comparison between two major container orchestration technologies, Kubernetes and Docker Swarm Mode, for OpenStack deployment. This shows you Pros/Cons of both orchestrators for the deploying purpose, as well as what are new pain points of operations on containerized OpenStack.

Leveraging Hybrid, SDDC & Multi-Cloud Best Practices to attain portability of your Cloud Workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Three leads in multi-infrastructure Ops. discuss real life examples of deploying applications that span multiple clouds and infrastructures as one contiguous platform. We’ll share best practices and architectures to ensure that workloads and applications are portable. Do you prefer not to become too over-reliant on one cloud? We’ll talk about common pitfalls that limit portability and how to avoid them. With few standards between public providers it is common to fall into the pit of vendor locked technology. The only standard that exists is the standard you make. Are you looking at containers because they enable your application portability? Please join us as we discuss how containers help improve your portability.  We will present data on various approaches to increase density, cover pros and cons of using containers on VMs, and talk about options like MAAS and Ironic.

Liberate your CloudFoundry installation from being constrained to a single cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud Infrastructure components are here to fail, while your service – in our case your cloud foundry installation – is here to stay available and keeps the hosted applications running. How do you stay available, while whole clouds are going down, either for maintenance or due to failure? At Swisscom we think that cloud infrastructure should be kept as simple as possible, meaning that it is here to deliver a platform that enables rapid delivery and deployment of cloud-native workload. Such a simplicity means that we keep a single stack to a single region and a single availability zone and for example do not stretch shared storage over two sites. However, what matters is that in the end users would still like to access their service running on top of Cloud Foundry and also the platform to deploy new applications should stay alive.

Lots of VMware Deployed? Integrate with OpenStack Cinder, Nova, Glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There's a lot of VMware out there and getting it to work with OpenStack isn't all that much of a heavy lifting project. There seems to be quite a few who would like to do this and either don't know how to or don't know where to look to find answers. There are quite a few things to learn about the drivers that help enable VMware to work with Cinder, Nova, and Glance. Lets go through a deep dive on each and show how you can easily get OpenStack working with VMware in your enterprise. You will learn the requirements for each driver and the configuration options that go along with it. We will then show demonstrations of each driver so you can see it in action. Come and see for yourself and start utilizing your vmware infrastructure with OpenStack.

Message Routing: a next-generation alternative to RabbitMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A broker can only scale so far.  The limitations of a broker-based messaging service are becoming apparent as Openstack deployments are pushed to ever higher scales and wider distributions.  An alternative to the broker-based message bus is needed. This presentation will introduce that alternative.  With the Newton release, the Oslo.Messaging library now includes support for a highly scalable, distributed, and fault tolerant brokerless message bus based on message routing rather than queueing. With this new technology one can achieve high availability through redundancy rather than clustering.  This message bus is optimized for operation across geographically distant sites, allowing for cloud distribution not possible with the single or federated broker approach.

Modularity in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack cloud is usually provided by a single vendor that ensures the interoperability and compatibility of the cloud services. As a result, cloud users (or even vendors of parts of the cloud) need to rely on the cloud provider to include services, OpenStack updates and extensions whenever those are needed. If the functionality of an OpenStack service that is not part of the cloud is crucial for the user, they can try to run the given service in a standalone mode and deliver it with their product. This setup involves all the operability, security and other aspects of delivering an OpenStack service. In this presentation, we argue for a more fine grained service provision setup and we show practical architectural patterns that make the extension of existing OpenStack services easier and practical.

Multi-site, without the explosions!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

To reach automatic high-availability and disaster-recovery, an OpenStack cloud should not be limited to a single datacenter; a true cloud environment should be stretched across multiple sites. A common theme we encounter when designing OpenStack clouds in enterprise settings is high-availability and disaster-recovery across sites. The rationale is that even if a complete datacenter fails, the cloud needs to continue to work. Multiple individual clouds with disaster-recovery between them fall short; they require an out-of-band backup and restore procedure, which needs to be manually implemented and does not guarantee latest data available on the failover cloud. In this session we will discuss the design of a stretched multi-site OpenStack cloud and provide a proven architecture, validated in real-world implementations. We will share the detailed requirements from the datacenter network interconnect down to OpenStack and storage configurations - without the explosions!

Neutron Mechanism Drivers: What to Ask Your Vendor​
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Do you use OpenStack deployment with a networking solution that is notthe reference implementation? Do you care for a stable and robustsolution?  If you do, you should ask your vendor how it handlesA-Synchronous invocation of networking backend, how does it handle outof sync resources and how does it report back errors to Neutron.In this session we’ll discuss why you care about these questions, whatstands behind them and why they are so important. We would also coverthe way these challenges are handled in OpenDaylight, in OVN and inDragonFlow, all open source solutions.

OpenContrail, Openstack and building a hardware and SDN integrated CICD Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operators at telco scale have large OpenStack setups beyond the typical neutron L3 gateway case. They typically have to integrate with more than one SDN vendor that will be different from who their physical networking infrastructure comes from. We faced challenges building, maintaining, and operating clouds at this scale and rolling out complex and new software releases. In this talk we explore the strategies large telco’s like AT&T employ and use when building their CI/testing chains and beyond how they plan to use off the shelf open source tools when testing them and how OpenStack helps make that easier.

OpenShift on OpenStack: Delivering Applications Better Together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many organizations have had success in dabbling with Linux Containers, and once they see a small project have success, the epiphany happens. This leads to additional questions, including:  1. Can we put everything in containers?  2. How do we get our traditional applications into containers?  3. Can we use containers in combination with virtual machines? In this session, we’ll address these the best approach for organizations to make the transition to containers for both new greenfield, and existing traditional applications. Attendees will learn how OpenStack is evolving to integrate with the Linux, Docker, Kubernetes stack to provide the ideal infrastructure platform for modern containerized applications. We’ll also cover an integrated approach to modern applications made up of containers and virtual machines, made possible with an OpenStack infrastructure.

OpenStack and DC/OS, worlds colliding or merging?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the common questions around OpenStack is “What’s the best way to run cloud native workloads on, or with, OpenStack”. Though OpenStack is the leading open source cloud platform, it’s mostly targeted for more traditional workloads running on bare metal or in VMs.Based on Mesos, DC/OS  is an open source data center OS, designed for running those cloud native and big data workloads at massive scale, efficiently solving the hard problems around cloud native scheduling and clustering.If squarely on one side or the other, your life is pretty easy. For those of us that have a wide variety of workloads, figuring out how to get the best of both worlds can be somewhat challenging.In this session we’ll explore the benefits from running OpenStack and DC/OS together and the use cases and scenarios where this bring the most value.We’ll take a look at the integration work we’ve done in this area and how it can be applied to maximize the benefit in heterogeneous environments.

Openstack and Kubernetes: One on Top of the Other, Vice-versa, or Sideways?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack and Kubernetes are leading management platforms in their respective areas: the former for general infrastructure and virtualization, the latter for containers orchestration. For the growing number of organizations that have decided to take advantage of both, a question arises: what is the best way to architect and integrate the two stacks? Historically, the safe answer seemed to be to deploy Kubernetes clusters "on top" of Openstack, using solutions such as Heat, Murano, or Magnum. Recently though, an alternate pattern is emerging: use Kubernetes as a base layer, and deploy Openstack as an "application" on it. What are the advantages of such an approach? Furthermore, a company may have deployed independent Openstack and Kubernetes stacks due to historical or organizational reasons. How can the company integrate the two to leverage their respective strengths? Finally, is it possible to use Murano as a unified catalog for both both Openstack and Kubernetes-based applications?

Openstack cloud sizing made easy: A simple openstack sizing tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this topic we will discuss the issues of translating typical customer cloud requirements into factors to be considered for designing an enterprise grade cloud. This helps cloud architects to understand the key considerations to taken into account while sizing. The session introduces a potential sizing tool to come up with the amount of hardware needed for the control and compute planes of the target openstack cloud. The sizing tool is built based on collective experiences gained in several sizing exercises. The tool takes in customers’ requirements as input and has the flexibility of letting the user configure values of the design parameters. The output would be approximate amount of hardware needed for the control and compute plane as well as block and object storage if needed.

Openstack Flavor series, an AWS Parity for Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack defines Flavors which is synonymous to instance Types in AWS, but what the opensource community lacks is clear categorization of flavors depicting various Tenant offerings and capabilities, something AWS and other public cloud providers have an edge. This session aims to introduce the concept of “flavor series” to draw the parity of flavor categorization in Openstack cloud. We will share process, flows and design on how to go about defining flavors series and creating, distributing and managing flavors and host aggregates over multiple independent cloud zones. You will learn how we leveraged HEAT Templates as a standard resource definition interface to perform our complete platform resource life cycle management. We will show recorded demo on how to use Openstack Resource Manager Framework we introduced at Austin Summit to accomplish this distribution.

OpenStack For VMware Technologists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Is OpenStack just a free alternative to VMware technologies or are there substantive differences? Is there a way to integrate VMware technologies like vSphere with OpenStack? As OpenStack continues to gain momentum and grow in user adoptoon, VMware admins and architects are being asked to evaluate, deploy and manage new OpenStack clouds. This presentation will walk through the OpenStack architecture and it's various components and explain them to VMware technologists using concepts familiar to them. We will walk through what uses cases are best for OpenStack and what use cases are best on VMware infrastructure. We will also drill down on how OpenStack is able to integrate with vSphere using the vCenter nova driver, neutron, and cinder. Although we will be briefly evaluate various OpenStack offerings that integrate with vSphere, this will NOT be a product pitch or product presentation. All technical detail presented will be based on the upstream code.

Openstack in Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack has already been designed with microservices in mind and now the time has come to start using it as designed. Deploying openstack components within a microservice architecture framework will allow you to scale, recover from disasters, redeploy and upgrade with ease. Containerizing these micro services will allow you to test and even deploy from the latest and greatest code from community, such as new features can be thoroughly checked before being rolled out to your production cloud.

OpenStack on Raspberry Pi: One Byte at a Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying an OpenStack cloud across multiple Raspberry Pi computers.  The idea that using multiple credit card sized computers that cost about $35 each to run an OpenStack cloud seemed like an intriguing idea.  The actual feasibility of it needed to be tested.  There are a few blog posts that describe the general idea; however, most of them were outdated and did not include the latest version of the Raspberry Pi, the Pi 3.  Using a cluster of these devices, we set out to see how feasible it would be to deploy OpenStack using only Raspberry Pi devices.  In total, between two of us, we had a Raspberry Pi 1, two Pi 2s, and several Pi 3s. Our goal: To set up OpenStack on these minimal devices, across the internet in two physical locations.

OpenStack: Shifting from Hardware to Software Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Gartner analyzed data centers for a period of 10 years and found that 47% of all problems were caused by cloud services outages, with a duration ranging between 40 minutes and five days. Ponemon Institute found that on average outages cost US$ 690.204.The increasing use of commodity hardware to build data centers will negatively contribute to the reliability of existing cloud computing platforms.Thus, the development of new techniques and methods to evaluate and increase the reliability of cloud platforms from a software perspective is fundamental.The first part of this presentation will present the mechanisms that pioneers, such as Amazon, Google, and Netflix, have already developed to increase the reliability of their cloud platforms.The second part of the presentation will describe how T-Systems and Huawei are exploring the use of fault-injection mechanisms to effectively increase the reliability of the Open Telekom Cloud platform from Deutsche Telekom, an OpenStack-based platform.

Orchestrate, Secure, Recover SRIOV Virtual Network Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You might have heard about SRIOV and its benefits to Customers requesting high speed and bandwidth to support the Virtual Network Function Needs, but still you might be missing an end to end picture on how to orchestrate, enforce security and how to recover a failed SRIOV VM. At AT&T we designed and made it simple for our VNF customers to create SRIOV networks via HEAT and Neutron and extension to NOVA Compute. And to better things, we have imposed security rules by using DPDK APIs to configure the Virtual functions and at the same time our design didn’t deviate much from Openstack APIs and governance. This will be a great opportunity for anyone looking to learn about how SRIOV and DPDK APIs work in tandem to provide fast data path networks for Virtual Network Functions in your private cloud and enterprise needs.

Real-time KVM as OpenStack NFV hypervisor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For network functions virtualization (NFV) workloads, telecommunications companies demand an extremely low-latency, real-time platform. Real-time makes sure there is a defined time limit for worst case latency. This is to process hard deadlines of workloads to avoid any disruption or failure. In this session, we will talk about: - Changes/configurations done in low level kernel-based virtual machine (KVM)/kernel level and how OpenStack is taking advantage of these changes. - Features we are using with real-time KVM like DPDK, vhost-user and OpenvSwitch to solve the latency and throughput needs of telecommunications companies. - Also, we will give a snapshot of performance numbers from our testing with OpenStack Platform and real-time KVM.

Rolling Upgrades - Performance between OpenStack Deployed in VMs and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation compares and evaluates the numerical rolling upgrades performance between OpenStack deployed in VMs and containers. Many operators are considering moving from VM-deployed OpenStack to container-deployed OpenStack partially because of better rolling upgrade performance provided by containers. However, no numerical test results are ever presented to show this performance improvements gained by containers during rolling upgrades. Thus, we want cover it in this presentation.

Scaling your cluster with more flexibility, efficiency and reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scaling is an important capability of cloud platform. Either auto or manual, users usually need to adjust their resource pool capacity to adapt to the change of workload. However, scaling is not just simply increasing or decreasing the size of cluster. Lots of issues need to be thought over to ensure the scaling progress is efficient, reliable and flexible enough to fulfill the demand of patical usage. In this presentation, we will deep dive into the (auto)scaling design of Senlin project and use real case to demonstrate how to reduce the overhead caused by nodes creating/deleting, how to make scaling flexible, and how to hanlde exception to make the scaling progress recovable and rollbackable.

Service Continuity with OpenStack Smaug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the main concerns of online businesses is ensuring service continuity in case of a major outage.  Most of the protections provided today deal with data replication from one site to the other, but is it enough? Most production environments have considerable amount of configuration, scripts, security settings and metadata, which accumulates. This metadata is not protected in case of a site disaster. OpenStack Smaug protects all the data which comprises a working environment.  It orchestrates protection plans and calls protection providers for each of the various protectable items in your environment, such as images, VMs, network topology, shared folders, and, yes, also volumes. Smaug APIs enable DR tools to focus on the orchestration of the DRP, instead of integrating with the many possible backup and protection tools and solutions. In this session, we will give a short introduction to Smaug project and dive into the Service Continuity use case in more details.

Service Discovery and Registration in a Microservices Architecture: what, why and how?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Microservices, Service Discovery and Registration have been heading towards the peak of inflated expectations on the Gartner Hype cycle for over the last year or so, but there has often been a lack of clarity as to what these are, why are they needed or how to implement them well. Service discovery and registration are key components of most distributed systems and service oriented architectures. In this session we will talk about what, why and how of service registration and discovery in distributed systems in general and OpenStack in particular. We will talk about some of the technologies that address this challenge like Zookeeper, Etcd, Consul, Mesos-DNS, Minuteman, SkyDNS, SmartStack or Eureka. We will also address how these technologies as well as existing OpenStack projects can be used to solve this problem inside OpenStack environments.

Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) even for the under-cloud – is that even possible?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Think back when you could go online and custom order your Dell server, thus holding little inventory, assembling on the fly. Imagine a pool of disaggregated hardware from which nodes can be dynamically composed and attached to or detached from a cloud, customized to the workload. For instance, a node for storage would be composed with significantly more SSDs than one for compute intensive workloads. Introducing Intel Rack Scale Design Extensions via PodManager that implements the Redfish API. We highlight its abilities to compose, boot, monitor, power on and off and address current limitations such as VLAN creation via APIs without directly programming the TOR Switch. We share Dell’s solution which integrates this with Fuel, to deploy OpenStack. Lastly, we share our motivation to develop Plasma, working with deployment tools such as Fuel, TripleO, Juju, to realize the vision of SDI, dynamically grow and shrink clouds through plugins in Nova, Ironic, Horizon and policies in Congress

Stateful Applications in OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Paypal moved stateless workloads to Openstack cloud a few years ago. At PayPal, 100% of front and mid-ier applications run on Openstack. The next logical step is to start moving stateful applications into cloud.   This presents a new set of challenges. In a multi-tenant environment, how do you guarantee that data access is restricted. Recovery is not as simple as spinning up a new compute instance. Data needs to be presented to this new instance ASAP. Load balancers do not solve the problem. Network block storage means you might choke other applications transacting over the network. Solutions range from onboarding these applications on bare metal computes in the cloud (buying some advantage by way of agility) to containerized solutions with a managed storage layer, engineered for fast recovery from failure.  We will present an introductory version of this talk at OpenStack East. This follow-up presentation tracks progress and provides more color to conclusions reached so far.

Swift and Hummingbird: As seen in the wild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hummingbird is the golang reimplementation of the OpenStack Swift object layer that is currently being reviewed by the upstream Swift community.  At Rackspace, we have deployed Hummingbird to our largest clusters. In this presentation we will go over how we deployed hummingbird and share the performance gains we made.  But beyond the customer API we have done a major redesign to the object replication engine. While not as obvious or apparent as the gains in the API this is a major improvement in cluster health and efficiency.

Taking OpenStack towards a hyperconverged future.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There has been a few very popular reference architectures of OpenStack that have changed throughout the different releases of OpenStack, but remained very much closely tied to the original formula.  At VEXXHOST, we've worked on building out a far more efficent and faster reference architecture which we've deployed many times for our customers successfully. This architecture is a hyper-converged setup where you can combine both storage and compute on the same node.  It's always been a big no-no to do this, but times have changed and this new architecture works and it's been proven in production.   This starts the discussion of perhaps moving to a new reference architecture for OpenStack.

Telco NFV Growing Pains – Real World Problems and Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many of the world's leading service providers are accelerating their movement towards wide-scale OpenStack deployments for Telco NFV applications. After several years of laying the preliminary groundwork in terms of architecture, standardization, and more recently proof of concept trials, operators across the globe are now solidifying deployment plans for NFV infrastructure and transitioning away from purpose-built hardware. But in the process of moving from the proof-of-concept phase to a deployable solution, operators have encountered many roadblocks such as performance, scaling, and interoperability issues. We will identify and focus on some of the most critical implementation issues facing NFV end users and service providers today, as they move towards large-scale deployments. Targeted use of NFVi acceleration in the form of SmartNICs will be discussed as a possible solution to address performance and scaling issues.

The Elephant in the Database: Keystone’s schema can’t scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The current Keystone database schema may suffice for 50 users across 10 projects, but it will break for any significantly large scale deployment. In this session, we will discuss the problems with the current schema, and offer a potential roadmap that would permanently solve these issues. * See what happens when we try to utilize 10,000 users, 1,000 projects, and 10 roles. * Hear what occurred in our production environment when table indices could no longer fit in memory. * Experience the significant scalability improvements Keystone could have with a simple schema change that can be implemented with little effort.

The final word on Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Availability zones are one of the most frequently misunderstood and misused constructs in OpenStack. And why not? Each OpenStack service implements them differently -- if it even implements them at all. And yet they are also one of the most important, providing a robust HA option for tenant applications.This session will definitively answer, once and for all, questions such as what availability zones are (and are not), which OpenStack services support AZs and how they relate to one another, the limitations of AZs and best practices and industry standards for using availability zones, including gotchas and lessons learned.

The glory and fallacies of abstraction APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The usage of abstraction APIs significantly reduces the effort of integrating one application with the cloud or services of the cloud. The talk will cover several abstraction APIs used to access the cloud or the NFV ecosystem. Several examples will be provided that show the limitations of using abstraction APIs in real world scenarios. The talk will aim to collect the main aspects that an architect should consider before choosing the "right" API.

The Key Components of Adopting CI The OpenStack Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack’s Continuous Integration (CI) structure is an invaluable tool for stabilizing builds and code repositories. Yet, some may feel that this implementation of CI is too cumbersome to adopt. This session will prove how easy it can be to adopt, configure and migrate existing projects. We will also discuss how a software team can benefit from a CI infrastructure that fits with the OpenStack way, how to stabilize it and which tools we use to do so: Ansible, Jenkins Job Builder, and our internally-developed tool, PrivateStack.

The Many Personas of Interoperability: Why Operators, Vendors, End Users, & OpenStack Devs Care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack has matured as a project over the past six years, it has created a vibrant ecosystem of users, products, developers, and operators.  As OpenStack has proliferated across the world, interoperability between OpenStack-powered clouds has become an increasing concern.  The DefCore Committee was created with a mandate to tackle the interoperability issue. As DefCore and the OpenStack Powered program have matured, we’ve come to recognize that there are distinct personas in the OpenStack community that care about interoperability for different reasons, are impacted in different ways, and can take different actions to help ensure an interoperable future for OpenStack.  In this talk, we’ll discuss some of the many personas who have a stake in the interoperability game, why they care, what actions they can take, and how DefCore’s work will impact them.

The Private Cloud Service Provider Blueprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building a Private Cloud business is hard! Don't be fooled. OpenStack is only one piece of the cloud provider puzzle. There are business considerations and technical components required such orchestrators, billing systems, and application catalogs that must all be considered to do it right. If you are faced with the daunting challenge of planning your business this is the session for you. Canonical has created a blueprint for private cloud service providers that can be followed which describes what it takes to move forward with your business plans. Attendees will follow along as we build out a fictional private cloud service provider using our service provider blueprint developed by the Consulting Architecture team. You will gain an understanding of not only the technical aspects of the service provider blueprint but also gain an understanding of the challenges that cloud providers need to solve before realizing their full potential.

The Road to Production Grade (lessons learned from our experience with Dragonflow)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Dragonflow is a young project, barely two years old.  We have been working hard at making it a good candidate for users that need a networking implementation that can scale to 10,000 hosts, and allow hosts with 10Gbps NICs to be fully utilized, even when running an overlay network with encap/decap.In this session we will share some of our experience and lessons learned while getting Dragonflow ready to handle such loads in Huawei's Enterprise Cloud:* Database Consistency in OpenStack Components* Publish Subscribe: Broker vs. ad-hoc vs. mesh (Peer-2-Peer)* Performance Maximisation and Testing Results

Tuning and Optimization of OpenStack Shared Services RabbitMQ and DBs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In setting up OpenStack in Production, there are a number of services like RabbitMQ and Databases that are shared between each of the OpenStack services. Each of these services need to adhere to tuning and optimizations so that each OpenStack service that rely on them can be performant in a Production environment.

Using Monitoring to Guide Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most cloud platform (and workload) migration stories start with expert knowledge (and surmise): about how apps work, how workloads are assembled, their dependencies, requirements and characteristics. But as cloud environments become more dynamic, apps and instances more numerous, and patterns of utilization more diverse, it makes sense to back up this technical understanding with empirical performance data and dependency analytics — to highlight candidates for migration, assist in migration planning, and provide performance baselines for predicting migration impacts. This is made possible by analytical monitoring tools that work across multiple cloud platforms, enabling parallel examination of multiple clusters, perhaps some remote and others local/on-premise — all through a single operator pane of glass. In this session, we'll present and demonstrate best-practice for using such tools to accelerate migration to OpenStack from other infrastructures.

Vanilla or distributions: How do they differentiate?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

If it comes to OpenStack there is always the question: vanilla or a distribution. You have the agony of choice, it will highly depend on your usecase and organization. This presentation will not only highlight differences and similarities between these choices but also between the major OpenStack distributions. We will take a look behind the curtain of the OpenStack products. What should you know about the offerings? Is there anything you may should evaluate before you choose a solution? There is more to take a look at than only the OpenStack product itself if you include also e.g. KVM and Ceph. What about the base distributions and support? This talk will cover besides Vanilla also RedHat, SUSE, Ubuntu/Canonical, and Mirantis OpenStack.

Virtual Machine HA on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many workloads in today’s datacenters are like pets. Their lifespan is in years; they run mission critical service that must be up 24x7. Modern, cloud native applications are designed to tolerate failures. The cloud methodology encourages Cattle approach which treats VMs as commodity. In the near future Pet workloads will coexist with Cattle due to many reasons - (1) During the transition from a datacenter environment to the cloud, a mix of workloads prevail. (2) Legacy applications cannot be easily converted to cloud paradigm. Given the state of enterprise workloads, Virtual Machine High Availability (VM HA) is a must have capability.In the OpenStack community, HA solutions typically deploy Pacemaker with Corosync. At Platform9, we chose Consul to implement a VM HA solution. We found it is easy to adopt and scalable. In this talk we present this feature, experience of running Pet VMs with HA in production and the metrics used to measure effectiveness of VM HA.


* **Sachin Manpathak** *(I lead core openstack projects at Platform9 such as Nova, Cinder and Keystone.

What are you waiting for? Using SDX + OpenStack for your private cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It would be a waste to use OpenStack only for managing resources because OpenStack can serve as the heart of whole your system management. Both SDN and SDS provide incredibly powerful architecture, especially when combined. You can completely integrate your network, storage and computing resources by using SDN/SDS with OpenStack. Now is the time to start using what will certainly be new standard. More specifically, we are using Big Cloud Fabric and Ceph as SDN/SDS in our production environment. Big Cloud Fabric is an especially unique SDN controller with its flexibility to support underlay networks. All combined, this setup allows us to manage our private cloud more efficiently than ever before. This session will explain how we integrate SDX with OpenStack and the potential benefits. It will hopefully provide some valuable hints for increasing the efficiency of your own private cloud.

What not to do with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It has been 6 years since the first OpenStack release and it is now widely known what use cases it fits and what potential it brings to your organization. Less known and talked about is what not to do with it.  Considering the complexity that OpenStack has gained, sometimes it’s not clear if adopting it in your own workflow is the best call. In fact, it’s not as simple as determining if OpenStack can work or not for you, but you also have to consider how you should deploy OpenStack to fulfill your needs. We will leverage real world use cases to explain when the effort required to migrate to OpenStack is worth it and when it is best to stick with a more traditional architecture. More often than not critical points may not be visible at first and, since these are the ones that define success or failure in a deployment, we will give a few tips on how to recognize them in the future.

When not to share - a Global Cloud Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we take a fundamental approach (with diagrams/pictures) to designing a Global Cloud for a customer. We discuss how to use a ‘shared-nothing’ approach, coupled with an orchestration layer that ties it all together. We discuss the reasons why this approach is best and why this discussion should happen before anything else in the move to Cloud. Our intent is to allow listeners to learn from our mistakes and successes, and start the Cloud journey out on the right foot. This is a 101-level talk, geared toward the IT business decicion makers (CxO, VP, Director, Manager), who need to the best way to approach Cloud before they spend resources on the effort.

Why should I consider a converged architecture for my OpenStack cloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The typical approach to architecting an OpenStack cloud deployment separates the deployment of the control plane of the cloud onto dedicated server infrastructure, providing physical separation from storage and compute services providing resources to tenants of the cloud. This approach has some limitations in terms of flexibility, fault tolerance and scalability. The Ubuntu OpenStack converged cloud architecture treats the control plane of the cloud as a discrete set of services. By spreading those services as far and wide as possible (including on storage and compute servers), we can achieve an high level of resilience, improve fault tolerance and increase the scalability of the individual components of the control plane an OpenStack cloud with no ‘special place’ for control plane services.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Will they blend? There's only one way to find out! Join experience DevOps mix-master, Rob Hirschfeld, in this fun and informative exploration. Since the OpenStack on Kubernetes keynote in Austin, there are been many discussions about if and how to deliver a Joint OpenStack Kubernetes Environment. Specifically, using Kubernetes as an underlay. In this presentation, we'll explore the potential benefits and downsides of this configuration. Then, assuming it's a good idea, we'll give into the real architectural and operational work needed to implement a robust OpenStack cloud using Kubernetes. We'll discuss the pros and cons of including the Nova compute nodes in K8s management. Finally, we'll outline upstream work that's needed to turn OpenStack into a cloud native application.

Big Data and Machine Learning on OpenStack backed by Nova-LXD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hadoop was built with bare metal in mind - get your commodity hardware, stick hadoop on it and let YARN do all the hard work managing resources. However, Big Data software deployments on other substrates such as AWS (ec2 and EMR), AZURE, GCE are gaining popularity. We look at the challenges and a relevant solution related to deploying big data software in an OpenStack cloud.  Perhaps most interestingly, we discuss and demonstrate what it looks like to run a machine learning job with Nova-LXD in that cloud to address data locality issues in virtualized environments, and to demonstrate that hypervisor overhead does not necessarily hinder Big/Fast Data processing.

Blockchain and OpenStack - Building Trusted Chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Financial organisations are currently looking with great interest at Blockchain databases. This is the same technology behind most crypto-currencies including bitcoin. The goal of Blockchain is to maintain a timestamped, immutable, continually growing list of records. Each block can hold batches of transactions and the results of any blockchain executables.OpenStack lends itself perfectly to the OpenStack platform for hosting as well as potentially providing solutions to some governance challenges such as those being addressed by the Congress Project.This talk will examine the architecture and profile of a blockchain application hosted on OpenStack, examine the challenges and the requirements that still need to be met as well look at what can already be achieved. Finally we will look at how this technology might provide governance solutions to cloud tenants within the platform and dovetail with the work going on in the Congress project and some potential benefits of this union.

Build a self healing Openstack cluster using Cognitive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data driven applications on cloud infrastructure increasingly rely on Machine Learning. This often requires application developers and data scientists to write their own machine learning pipeline or deploy other packages to do some kind of data transformation and apply ML primitives. Data scientists also need to have an easy way to rapidly experiment with data without having to write basic infrastructure for the above operations. Often setting up data pipelines is the biggest barrier to rapid exploration of the design space and application development.  Cognitive is a ML service on top of OpenStack which provides ML based services to tenants (API, workbench, compute service).  In this talk, we present how you can use Cognitive to learn how to cluster activity from Openstack logs, obtain data insights and take corrective measures in realtime.  Openstack systems generate huge amounts of logs/metrics which can be fed into Cognitive for realtime predictive analytics and cluster tuning.

Efficient ways to run big data in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Customers are eager to put big data services into Cloud. There are many projects like Sahara, Cloudera Director, or Cloudbreak in the market to help the customers to implement Hadoop in the cloud. But performance is always the most critical issue when considering big data in OpenStack. In this presentation, we would like to teach you how to configure Hadoop/Spark in OpenStack. We will use some real customer cases to point out most of the issues that you may concern when running a real big data workload in OpenStack. We did lots of performance testing and would like to show you the results and the gaps between bare metal and virtualization. We also proposed several efficient ways including both OpenStack and Hadoop/Spark configuration to enhance the performance and reduce the gap to integrate big data services into OpenStack easier.

Hadoop on Openstack Cloud: The Elephant can fly!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditionally Hadoop is deployed on physical servers located on customer premise. This trend is changing with the advancements of cloud technology. A cloud deployment offers the ability to conveniently scale the cluster as needed. Multi-tenancy is also a big advantage when it comes to facilitating multiple users on the same physical hardware. Furthermore, a cloud deployment, coupled with multi-tenancy, is greatly complimented by the resources and security segregation. Each tenant has full control over their resources without incurring any risk to the resources managed by the other tenants. Join us and learn how Hadoop can be deployed on an Openstack cloud using the Openstack Sahara project. The presentation will also show how an Openstack cloud can be optimized to get the performance of a Big Data workload on the Cloud to match as closely as possible that on a bare-metal configuration.

HDFS and Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditionally, Hadoop clusters have been built using dedicated hardware separated from the rest of the data center IT infrastructure. The rapid growth of HDFS/Hadoop/Spark/Yarn applications makes it desirable to share the services-oriented virtualized infrastructure commonly known as private cloud. While virtualizing compute and network interconnectivity is a relatively well-solved problem. Virtualizing the HDFS storage component into the private cloud work has unique challenges. This talk explores those challenges and offers multiple prescriptive solutions along with criteria to allow planners and architects to meaningfully compare and contrast the different approaches.

Object Storage Analytics: Leveraging Cognitive Computing For Deriving Insights And Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Object storage has become a de facto cloud storage. Analytics over data stored on object store for deriving greater insights is an obvious exercise being looked by implementers. In object stores like SWIFT, user-defined metadata associated with objects has the ability to provide quick relevant insights of data and can be leveraged for analytics. But having relevant user defined metadata with every object is one of the inhibitors for such analytics. On the other hand, there are Cognitive Computing services that are now available which leverage extreme data analysis using machine learning techniques for data interpretation. In this presentation, we discuss how cognitive services can help enrich object stores for analytics by self-tagging objects which can be used for data analytics as well as for deriving object relationships. The presentation includes a manifestation of the above using on OpenStack SWIFT implementation and a popular cognitive service in marketplace like IBM Watson.

Case Study: Building a fully automated developer workflow using OpenStack on VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Alert Logic is a leader in security and compliance solutions for the cloud, providing Security-as-a-Service for on-premises, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures powering enterprises worldwide. The IT team inside Alert Logic standardized on VMware as their private infrastructure of choice for it’s stability and performance. However, they had to build a significant amount of automation inhouse (a ruby on rails application) to automate deployment of workloads on a variety of platforms – Vmware, AWS, LXC etc. all their deployment tools interacted directly with VMware vCenter. And the automation still did not fix the need for end-users to have direct access to vCenter for console and other use cases. This conflicted with Alert Logic’s policy of doing everything as-a-service and enabling self-serve model for users. This talk describes Alert Logic’s use case of building a powerful automation using OpenStack with VMware, and ruby on rails with chef to automate their developer workflows.

Cazando Mitos en OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Todos nos hemos preguntado cosas como: "¿Es OpenStack un competidor de AWS y VMware?", "¿Está OpenStack listo para producción?", o "¿Va a reemplazar OpenStack toda nuestra infraestructura virtual?". Aunque bien es cierto que OpenStack proporciona una solución para mucha gente con diferentes intereses y objetivos, todavía hay algunas particularidades que debemos tener en cuenta antes de ponernos en marcha. Después de haber trabajado con clientes en OpenStack, nos hemos dado cuenta de que en muchos casos la realidad no cumple con las expectativas. Por eso, es importante que los nuevos stakers entiendan la realidad, la separen de los mitos, y sepan cómo sacarle el máximo partido a OpenStack. En esta sesión explicaremos algunos de los mitos más comunes sobre OpenStack recogidos de nuestros propios clientes y enumeraremos las diferentes ideas preconcebidas que los nuevos usuarios tienen cuando comparan OpenStack con otras herramientas, clouds, o servicios.

Cisco Intercloud migration from Ceph to Swift while in production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This is the story about how Cisco Intercloud migrated from Ceph Rados Gateway (RGW) to OpenStack Swift while in production and without service interruption. To prepare for the migration we collected vital data in the Cisco labs on storage requirements, throughput, latency, etc. A migration plan including all dependencies, such as RGW, Swift, networking, load balancing, SSL termination, Keystone endpoint switch-over and data migration was created. If any of these things weren't planned in detail, a seamless cut-over could not be guaranteed. The SwiftStack data migrator and cluster shunt middleware were key components to the migration. The migrator maintains thresholds to make sure the data movement won't hurt throughput in the Ceph cluster. The SwiftStack shunt middleware allows RGW and Swift to co-exist and ensures service during the cutover period. Throughout the migration, monitoring is watching the status of both Ceph and Swift, providing status reports of the migration progress.

Developing for OpenStack APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building a cloud orchestrator is not like building any other cloud application. Not because it is more challenging, they’re all challenging...but because an orchestrator needs to expose the full range of functionality that the underlying cloud exposes. If the orchestrator can't provide the full range of cloud services, what good is it ultimately? That is why integrating with the cloud SDK correctly requires users to have access to the full range of API functions and parameters through the orchestration template. In this talk we’ll describe the techniques we used to expose the full OpenStack SDK to Cloudify blueprints, some of the pitfalls encountered, and how we overcame them.

How Four Superusers Measure the Business Value of their OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Businesses care about outcomes — not so much about the specifics of your technically-beautiful OpenStack cloud implementation. This mismatch of priorities often results in "orphan clouds" — clouds that have no tenants, and no buy-in from business leadership.. How to avoid this impasse? Simple: You need to make sure your cloud is delivering measurably beneficial outcomes. How? we've asked the experts: four OpenStack superusers (each with at least a year's successful experience running OpenStack at scales of 100 to 1,000 physical nodes); we've  extracted concrete business value metrics, and learned what practices made these users' OpenStack implementations wildly successful. You can benchmark your own cloud efforts against these metrics, use them to justify an OpenStack project internally to your CXO and demonstrate value to tenants to grow internal adoption. Our superusers will share lessons learned, so you can copy their best practices and avoid their mistakes.

For enterprises running OpenStack based private cloud, adding public cloud resources is an attractive proposition. A hybrid cloud offers pay-as-you-go flexibility of a public cloud combined with security and privacy of a private cloud. However, the complexity poses a barrier to its adoption. In this talk, we show how to use the OpenStack API layer as the unifying interface for hybrid-cloud management. We found that this approach solves a number of use cases for managing workloads on public cloud like AWS. It enables uniform experience, simplicity and portability for cloud tooling and applications. We have extended the OpenStack control pane by building AWS-specific drivers for Nova, Glance, Cinder and Neutron. We added Platform9’s brownfield discovery technology to further ease the ingestion of AWS workloads into an OpenStack-driven cloud. This approach can easily be extended to other clouds as well, making the holy grail of multi-cloud a reality.

HPC on OpenStack - real world deployments and use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the first portion of this session we will examine three real world implementations of HPC workloads deployed on OpenStack.  We will take a close look at each environment and discuss both the technical and business drivers behind selecting OpenStack as well as the specifics of the workload types – grid analytics, genomics and computational chemistry.   In the second portion of this session we will cover the specific technology of each of these three deployments including technical architecture, sizing, scale, underlying systems, project selection and other design, configuration and deployment aspects.   Throughout the session we will tie these use cases and technology back to a growing industry trend of “Mode 2 HPC” and what that means for HPC practitioners and organizations that want to leverage OpenStack as HPC continues to adopt private cloud technologies.

Hybrid Cloud migration and recovery using OpenStack Smaug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

 The ability to implement a comprehensive DR solution is a critical requirement for enterprise-grade readiness. OpenStack Smaug provides a framework of APIs and services to orchestrate data protection and recovery of all the entities that comprise a production site.  Smaug APIs simplify the process of building a viable Disaster Recovery mechanism between the running site and an independent DRP site, that runs in a completely separate OpenStack instance. In this session, we will share how Huawei uses OpenStack Smaug in its Hybrid Cloud solution to implement a cross-cloud disaster recovery, helping its customers to protect their data in the public cloud, or on another private cloud, while retaining a very short “back to business” time, in case of a service outage.

I don’t always attach volumes, but when I do its host based and with os-brick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, people can expect to get a better understanding of what os-brick really is, where it came from, and where it’s going. Initially os-brick was designed to handle host-based volume attaches and detaches, but has since grown to be much more than that. It supports a variety of transport protocols, operating systems, and architectures- it’s more than just iSCSI on Linux x86. With this expansion, os-brick hasn’t been immune to controversy within the community.  It’s faced many challenges with replacing rootwrap with privsep, and is under discussion whether or not the host based attachment approach should be replaced with QEMU direct attaches. By the end of this talk, you will walk away with an understanding of the basics and history of os-brick, how it is continuing to grow and develop, and what areas are being debated.

Let's Oversubscribe the OpenStack environment and try to find the weaknesses and improvements.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Oversubscription of SDI is not a trivial problem.Numerous questions to be answered and tradeoffs to be fine-tuned.Is it worth to stressing the environment to the max?Where are the limits and bottlenecks? Let's find the sweet-point of the performance-SLA pair!As the OpenStack Performance Team we've executed countless tests and gathered gigabytes of data to verify that. During the talk we will present new open testing framework that we have developed.*It's features include running workloads in different conditions,measuring them and visualize.*We will describe the methodology and show the analysis of stack under the businesses line applications stress.According to the Delft University of Technology:"CPU utilization is higher than memory utilization,which is the opposite of the finding of Diet for the Google trace.This is because that business-critical workloads are more in line with grid workloads".You will walk out of this presentation knowing exactly who is right in this dispute.

Multi-location Cloud Health Tracking - Building an Operations Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will cover a custom approach to tracking cloud health across many geo-locations. There are multiple OpenStack solutions for monitoring, but these tend to focus on single-location, with an opinionated approach to the data they collect and how they collect it. We have investigated various methods of extracting metrics from all the OpenStack IaaS and PaaS components, and built a custom dashboard to display this data from the 75+ OpenStack clouds deployed inside AT&T. The dashboard allows both users and operators to see the data they need, in order to maintain their applications and services across multiple locations.

Networking Down Under: Proving OpenStack across a large-scale academic research network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NeCTAR is an Australian Government project conducted as part of the Super Science initiative, and led by the University of Melbourne. NeCTAR was an early adopter of OpenStack Essex, using nova-networking. They knew that migration from nova-networking to Neutron would be challenging. NeCTAR knew they wanted an open-source Neutron plugin from a vendor with excellent community credibility. Running OpenStack at scale with over 7000 instances, 1000 hosts, across 10 datacenters, NeCTAR needed a solution that was easy to install and provided both basic networking features and advanced services that can handle such scale. They chose MidoNet.

No team? No problem! (How a single admin manages 70 OpenStack nodes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One complaint we always hear about OpenStack is that managing an big environment takes a team of people, but we've found that it's simply not true. In this talk, you'll see how switching to OpenStack actually saved us time and money by replacing a few dozen workstations with just two OpenStack clusters that consist of 70 nodes -- all managed by a single admin. More than that, though, we'll talk about issues you're likely to face and how to solve them, as well as what we needed to do to make it possible for one person to manage all of these resources.


* **Atze de Vries** *(I have a background in astrophysics and art. I've started operating Openstack 3 years ago. We then did our own deployment using Puppet. Our newer Openstack deployments are deployed with Fuel.  In my free time i like to do some alpine climbing and rock climbing. )*

One cloud. Openstack.  Kubernetes. One hour. A managed OpenStack success story.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is hard.  At least it has been for some time.  It requires resources to manage and expert knowledge on-site, and downtime remains a nagging fear. With the proliferation of containers, cloud teams now have to manage two systems, with 4X (2^2) the worry. Indeed, the “OpenStack or containers?” question consumes further resources in unproductive debate. No longer.  Dell, Platform9 and Midokura have teamed to delivered a solution that is easy to deploy, leverages SDN, minimizes resource overhead, reduces TCO, and best of all: unifies OpenStack and Kubernetes workload management within a single interface

OpenStack and the US Army or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bureaucracy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When one thinks of business agility, maximizing productivity, and bleeding-edge technology, one generally doesn't think of the United States Army.  In fact, some people might imagine that an organization with 1.38 million employees would be the exact opposite of agile.  Some people might imagine a crushing bureaucracy that snuffs out innovation in favor of policy and procedure.  Some people might imagine a myriad of internal organizations whose sole purpose is to tell you why you can't do something.  Some people might even imagine that there would be exactly zero internal support for anything that deviates from "normal". These people would be absolutely correct. Yet, a fully functioning (and rapidly growing) OpenStack deployment is at the heart of the training program at the United States Army Cyber School.  Come learn how we navigated this project through one of the most innovation-unfriendly organizations on earth, how we use OpenStack, and where we plan to go from here.

Towards to an Intelligent Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Intelligent cloud without human intervention is the ultimate goal of openstack. This presentation shares our story of how to achieve it. We are maintaining a cloud for developer usage for totally different purpose: * build server for CPU intensive workload, like andorid build. * openstack development like devstack environment setup, requires huge network bandwidth The trend of workload and users is not predictable, so need add new servers in peak time and remove them when idle. Furthermore, long time heavy work load usually makes server broken, so that we need identify then remove them in the 1st time. We try to use automation, but some steps still requires human intervention. Then we found Watcher, resource optimization in openstack, and defined our own strategies for workload balance & server consolication. Also developed some algorithm based on power/temperature metrics for intelligent management. Finally, our smart cloud runs well without any human intervention.

Using RUP, XP and Kanban Programming For OpenStack Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Development process is fairly well documented and requirements for specific interactions with Git, Jenkins, Garrit and Zuul are somewhat straightforward. However, when it comes to the specifics on the developer's side, you're largely on your own. This is especially problematic in a world where development is moving from more traditional IT infrastructures to a more cloud-native architecture, so processes are already in flux. This talk will provide a guide to some of the more proven methods and practices that can be applied to achieve positive results, and how they apply to development in OpenStack.

It was clear to them that OpenStack could fully manage their private infrastructure across VMware and KVM, and integrating with Cisco ACI. But what about the need for a single platform across public and private clouds? Other hybrid CMPs were an option but they have a lot of overlap in functionality with OpenStack and the AVG team prefers using OpenStack API due to compatibility with devops tools they use. So they asked themselves: why not consolidate using OpenStack? This talk will highlight how AVG was able to collaborate within the community to build AWS-specific drivers for OpenStack to deliver a fully hybrid implementation at AVG.

Why you shouldn't fork OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Following upstream is not easy.There are training sessions and mentoring to help but sometimes the problem is not knowing how to do it but not having time to do it properly. As cloud operators we have day to day constraints and we often need to fix and patch as soon as possible which is not really compatible with upstream at first look. After more than one year in production with many internal patches, we learned that we have no other choice than committing upstream our previous and future modifications and that's why we need a smart solution to do what we couldn't do before.We don't want to maintain our fork of OpenStack so we are currently improving this contribution process and we would like to share our mistakes and discoveries on our journey with OpenStack.

App Delivery to App Catalog: Deploying Direct to Murano for More Consumable Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Whatever the specifics of a cloud use-case may be, the need for speed is universal. Most private, public and hybrid cloud users want to reduce time-to-value by speeding up Dev/Test and deploying faster to staging and production. Mirantis has introduced a set of technologies called Murano that serves these needs directly. Murano leverages Community App Catalog to accumulate and share expertise, and supports compiling and delivering pre-defined apps, on demand, as building blocks for different use cases. In this session, I'll discuss recent upgrades to Murano and describe how it can be used to package, standardize, and facilitate consumption and application of software development, application lifecycle management, container cluster, I'll show how apps can be built and deployed directly into Murano from standard IDEs and as the end-product of CI/CD toolchains, to further accelerate access to tools.

Application Catalogs: understanding Glare, Murano and Community App Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack matured and began reaching the upper layers of the Cloud stack, a number of OpenStack projects started working with cloud applications. Soon enough several initiatives emerged to build services which would provide various catalog-like functionality for these apps. The most notable of these initiatives are project Murano, an Openstack big-tent project officially known as "Application Catalog for Openstack", project Glare (aka GLance ARtifact REpository, previously known as Glance v3) and a Community Application Catalog, an initiative backed by Openstack Foundation, hosting some cloud apps at apps.openstack.org.

Applications as first-class citizens on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has delivered on the promise of democratizing management of infrastructure layer for operations' teams. But what about application developers? App developers' concern are primarily based around life-cycle management of their applications. Can they deploy applications written in their language of choice on OpenStack? Can they easily configure CI/CD pipelines for their applications? Is it possible to trigger application deployment by pushing code to their applications' repositories? How to achieve resource isolation across application life-cycle stages of test, build, and deploy? Can they define scaling policies? How about choosing containers vs. VMs as application deployment targets? This, and much more is now possible natively on OpenStack. In this talk we present how OpenStack Solum has made applications first-class citizens of OpenStack enabling app developers to abstract away infrastructure in their application development pursuits.

Applications for OpenStack, Developing and Consuming using Community Application Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Now when OpenStack is mature and have it up and running is not a big deal, focus of OpenStack community and customers shifts from "how do I get a running cloud" to "what do I do with running cloud". Variety of applications is huge, from LAMP stacks and legacy Java apps to telco workloads and VNF apps. There is working group which works on a definition of "What is OpenStack application", hopefully community will agree on definition soon. Definition is not yet there, but there is already an integration and distribution point for OpenStack applications, Community Application Catalog (https://apps.openstack.org). There are many applications in the catalog, contributed by OpenStack vendors, Linux and other software vendors and independent contributors.

Building Bridges to Fill Gaps between AWS and OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs application code in response to events. Lambda automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create new back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. AWS Lambda can automatically run code in response to multiple events, such as modifications to objects in Amazon S3 buckets or table updates in Amazon DynamoDB. There is currently no equivalent project in the OpenStack Big Tent. Iron.io is an enterprise job processing system for building powerful job-based asynchronous software that can deliver the same capabilities and functions as AWS Lambda. Simply put: developers write jobs in any language using familiar tools like Docker, then trigger the code to run using Iron.io’s REST API, webhooks, or the built-in scheduler.

Building self-healing applications with Aodh, Zaqar and Mistral
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Explore how OpenStack can provide highly-available monitoring of your application at any scale. Automatically scaling and healing applications based on resource/application status or workload is at the heart of the OpenStack value proposition. It is one of the key capabilities that differentiate cloud vs. traditional infrastructure such as VMware. We'll talk about how to make your applications autonomous by using Zaqar to get notifications from an OpenStack cloud and use them to autonomously manage the application's own infrastructure, so that people with pagers sitting in front of monitors and clicking on things don't have to. Then we'll demonstrate how to use new features in OpenStack to build a cloud application that is self-healing in the face of VM failure.

Enabling AWS S3+Lambda-like functionality with OpenStack Swift and OpenWhisk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Does the concept of server-less architecture intrigue you? OpenWhisk (https://git.io/vKeu3) accelerates innovation through creative chaining of microservices into highly scalable applications. By abstracting away infrastructure, OpenWhisk frees small teams to rapidly work on independent pieces of code simultaneously, keeping development focused solely on creating essential business logic.  OpenWhisk allows you to create rules to connect events with actions and compose microservices that get executed independently and in parallel. With a bit of code, you can have OpenWhisk process events from your Swift Object Storage; similar to what you can do with Lambda functions and AWS S3 storage.   As an example, we will demonstrate how you can create an OpenWhisk action to transform an image into a thumbnail whenever a new (larger) image is uploaded into a Swift Container. In this session, we will cover: OpenWhisk and server-less computing Code modifications required A DEMO of it in action!

Exposing Custom Self-service Applications on OpenStack? Horizon, Heat, CLI, Keystone, Oh My!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You built a custom self-service application (with RESTful APIs) and now you want to expose it to all users of your OpenStack cloud. Though APIs are the ultimate way to interact with any service, users typically consume different OpenStack services via Horizon, CLI, or Heat. Further, users expect that their keystone token should get them access to all services (albeit at different privilege levels depending on their keystone roles). So, unless you integrate your application with all of these OpenStack services and tools, you will have hard luck enticing users to try out your application. In this session, we share our experiences in exposing a self-service networking and analytics application that runs on OpenStack. Further we also present the lessons learned (especially pitfalls-to-avoid when developing your application) and opportunities for improvements in these OpenStack services (Horizon, Heat, etc.) and their architectures that ease building and exposing self-service applications.

Getting Started with OpenStack Python SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Python SDK is designed to improve developer experience by consolidating the various OpenStack python- client libraries and command line interface into a unified, well designed, and user-focused SDK ("Software Development Toolkit"). In this talk, we'd like to discuss what the Python SDK is, how it is designed, and how one can use OpenStack Python SDKs. With a consumer application requiring various individual pythons clients to install, each with different APIs and nuances, it becomes increasingly difficult to consume OpenStack clouds. The python-OpenStack SDK project proposes a new project with a single API namespace ("OpenStack") that would provide users with a single point of entry and series of supporting functions/methods from which to build applications and tools.

Heat and Its Alternatives: Application Deployment in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When dealing with the deployment of arbitrarily complex virtual application stacks, OpenStack comes with a highly powerful built-in facility: Heat. However, Heat is not the only way to deploy applications within OpenStack — in this session, we'll look at Heat plus two available alternatives: Juju, and Cloudify. In particular, this session covers the following questions: How can I deploy applications with Heat, Juju, and Cloudify? What architectural assumptions does each tool make? How can I deploy multi-node cloud applications? How specific to OpenStack is each solution? What's my expected learning curve? Having worked with all three tools extensively, we're able to give an unbiased, impartial comparison of all three tools.

How to build Murano cloud application from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Imagine, you have access to OpenStack cloud and need to spin on some complex workload there. Usually, most parts of workload are common, such as database, web server, proxy and so on. But in real life, it often happens that some important part of picture, like, for example, brand new service written on Go, is missing in the community catalog. How user can deal with it? Murano project suggests a solution. Using Murano, users can build complex cloud environments from ready-made blocks and bake new ones if necessary.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Innovating in the applications for the cloud is one of the top priorities for OpenStack. Nowadays, OpenStack is a mature platform which next challenge is to shift its community mindset from "How do I get a running cloud?" to "What can I do with a running cloud?". To accomplish this new approach, OpenStack needs cloud application developers aboard. OpenStack Cloud App Hackathons are a series of events that last a month; where developers, operators, designers, students and entrepreneurs are challenged to develop the best possible cloud based application during a weekend. Participants will be trained by top notch open cloud application developers, guided and mentored by the leaders in the cloud computing industry. The Guadalajara Hackathon is the second one of numerous of worldwide hackathons for building a stronger open cloud community in the region. The hackathon is pursuing innovation and knowledge. But above all, share and increase the number of diverse-open-cross-cloud applications.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Developing Cloud aware apps can be difficult. Managing the build, test, and deployment environments of cloud-aware apps increases its complexity. As your application uses more services the complexity increases exponentially. At Intel we attacked the problem by leveraging OpenStack and Jenkins (a continuous integration system) to simplify environment management for developers. In this session we will cover the logical and physical architecture of our integration of Jenkins and OpenStack; Demonstrate examples of Heat templates and their uses in the different development environments; expose the pitfalls that we uncovered in automating the management of these environments; and share the best practices of developing in a dynamic cloud environment.

Metadata search: Finding a needle in OpenStack Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every day, terabytes, if not petabytes, of unstructured data is uploaded into OpenStack Swift. The problem with unstructured data is just that, it’s unstructured. To help empower end-users and make the data more valuable, indexing metadata that resides in Swift makes for a very powerful solution in a large amount of use-cases. Marrying object storage, and it's native metadata capabilities, with indexing technologies like Elasticsearch greatly simplifies and enhances the data and makes it more valuable and actionable. In this session we will provide examples of how to work with metadata in Swift, indexing it all, and searching across your pool of valuable data.

The Cloud Management Roundup: CMP vs. PaaS vs. Orchestration (Application & Infrastructure)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The goal of all cloud management tools, as the name implies, is to have your application fully managed. There are three subtly different categories that offer tooling for this: PaaS (Platform as a Service), CMP (Cloud Management Platforms), and orchestration tools - where some are better for managing resources (e.g. VMs, data, secrets) and chargeback, when others excel at dev >> test >> build straight from your IDE, while others are standard-driven, e.g. TOSCA, and are targeted at hybrid stacks and environments.

Understanding our OpenStack Application Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Over the last six months, the App Ecosystem and OpenStack UX working groups have been conducting user research to identify issues that prevent application developers from adopting OpenStack. The Application Developer Study is a significant research initiative because, at the bottom line, application developers are our customers. Failure to meet these customers’ needs will have an impact on the adoption and growth of OpenStack as reference for cloud application development. The research included a series of interviews with five application developers followed by a survey completed by a larger sample of developers. The aim of the interviews was to generate rich data and help working groups propose initiatives that may impact adoption within the cloud application developer’s community. The intention of the survey was to validate the initiatives with a larger sample of application developers.

Unified Command client and SDK for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStackClient (OSC) is an unified command client for OpenStack. It has implemented 5 core projects‘ basic commands, and provides a plugin mechanism for other clients to work with it. OpenStack SDK is a library providing APIs for those apps who want to communicate with OpenStack core services. Using OSC and SDK will avoid unnecessary dependency, and obtain well organized commands and APIs. We have made great progress in these two projects (600+ commits) in 2016. Keystone has deprecated its command client. Nuetron is migrating from Neutron client to OSC. Nova has clarified that Nova client will be deprecated, and suggested to enhance OSC. 17 other projects have implemented their clients as OSC plugin. We also integrated SDK into OSC to implement commands. OSC PTL Dean shared why we need unified client during the keynotes in Austin, but didn't give much detail. Now, many developers started to use OSC, and joined OSC and SDK community. So, it's time to know the inside of OSC and SDK.

Unikernels on OpenStack: Toward Secure and Lightweight Software Appliances in the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Unikernels are sealed, specialized machine images and are emerging as efficient and secure alternative for deploying applications. An application built as a unikernel is compiled and linked with only the OS components necessary for its operation.  By design, unikernels boot extrememly fast, have small footprints and small attack surfaces. These characteristics make unikernel a perfect fit for deploying software appliances (e.g. NFV, Security appliance) in a cloud environment.  Because unikernels are specialized per application, new lifecycle management methodology and tools need to be developed to compile, build, and deploy unikernels efficiently in the cloud. In this talk, we demonstrate and discuss: 1) extensions to OpenStack (Glance, Nova, and Solum) to enable unikernel as a first-class resource like VM and container, 2) impact of using unikernels to deploy software appliances in the cloud, and 3) lessons and challenges from operationalizing unikernels using OpenStack.

Cloud Models & Economics
------------------------


"Does IT Matter?" redux: pricing as a strategic differentiator for cloud domination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As any Summit attendee knows, much discussion through today has focused on implementation minutiae, the cloud equivalent of "speeds and feeds." With OpenStack reaching maturity, and "basic" features more or less widely available, the competitive focus will shift to business differentiators: positioning, tactical sales execution, and pricing <- our topic today. Drawing on my experience licensing the original OpenOffice.org, as well as teaching behavioral economics, I will discuss pricing models we see in use today, as well as pricing shifts we can expect to develop over the next 6-24 months. As an independent networking vendor, Midokura partners across hardware, software and services, and I draw from partners to present case studies where pricing proved to be the decisive competitive weapon. Last but not least, I discuss practical applications of behavioral economics to cloud software pricing, and suggest "predictably irrational" techniques useful for both vendors and operators.

So think as you (the passenger) as a workload, you have to go from A to B and a carrier may not have too many passengers on that route, but it will use an Alliance to retain the customer and give him/her the necessary business outcome. Why cloud workloads should be treated differently? Why Cloud Providers that are strong and competitive in a region should not win your business? Well using Alliance all this would be possible.

Billing OpenStack with Ceilometer  - How Bits get to Coins.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In recent times, more and more companies migrate their infrastructure stack onto OpenStack. But when it comes to the challenge of building a cloud and billing its users, they fail due to missing appropriate solutions. The available ones are often lacking of necessary features, are inflexible and even cost intensive. Additionally the solutions often need intensive and complex configuration to be even able to collect data relevant for billing purposes. A question arising through those challenges is:Can OpenStack be billed by itself?During his talk Christian Brinker answers this with a clear ‘Yes’. He points out, how only based on Ceilometer the relevant data can be collected and processed. Backed up by his experiences from public and private Cloud projects, he presents common mistakes in the configuration of Ceilometer and shows ways to automatically derive invoices from Ceilometers raw data. Thereby topics like scalability or the connection to third-party systems are discussed as well.

Consuming IT: How to shift from fixed IT cost allocation to an on-demand model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The legacy Enterprise IT model is constraining. As the world moves to agile IT consumption, enterprises are limited in how they can adapt their IT cost allocation to a flexbile, on-demand model. Why allocate 12 months of IT costs to a project when AWS charges for services consumed by the hour? This presentation will show how Enterprises can evolve from their fixed IT cost allocation models to a more dynamic, on-demand cost allocation model, turbo-charging their agile IT initiatives. A case study of how an Enterprise made this successful shift will be presented in detail.

Do OpenStack Private Clouds Provide Cost Savings Over Public Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session is for OpenStack operators that want to hear about on-premise OpenStack total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) from their peers. A panel of OpenStack customers will discuss public cloud vs. OpenStack private cloud TCO. Let’s face it, everybody talks about benefits such as Agile IT etc. but when it comes down to it, cost often becomes the most important consideration. With a public cloud, you get a monthly bill telling you exactly how much it cost. However, private cloud costs are not always obvious or easy to measure. So how should operators compare these two different implementations? This user panel will discuss topics such as: do you really save money with a private cloud? If so, why and how much? What are some obvious considerations? What are some non-intuitive or non-obvious considerations? Additionally the panel will talk about best practices that can lead to solid TCO savings and mistakes that could destroy any TCO savings.

Double Win! Helping to consolidate OpenStack implementations (and build a Startup in the meantime)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we plan to expose our really great fun trip from being part of a DevOps team to founding an OpenStack startup in 1 year, using Open Source software to develop a product to leverage OpenStack operation to IT departments, helping users to understand what's going on while operating, thus helping build OpenStack Talent. We often hear "Too much time trying to debug things”, "The cost of acquiring OpenStack talent is high", "If you think that you can run a cloud by leveraging existing IT Ops, think again." - These phrases were our inspiration to try to develop a solution that could answer and help to consolidate OpenStack implementations. On the technical side, our solution is 100% Python based (backend), and gets information from OpenStack APIs, Linux processes, logs, etc. to notify on events and get the information displayed in a beautiful dashboard. It's very extensible, so the agent can be enhanced in features just by developing a plugin.

Hybrid Private Cloud - The Only way to Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For too long, the purist’s answer to the question of how to run legacy workloads in the cloud has been “don’t bother, they aren’t a fit.” This answer is neither helpful nor correct. There is a valid way to run legacy workloads, hybridized across legacy and cloud infrastructure, as your team works toward the eventual full refactoring of the application (or sunsetting as appropriate). In this talk, we will offer an approach to legacy and mixed workloads, which may not be a full fit in and of themselves, but are still mission critical to your enterprise. We discuss how to run these workloads in a hybridized private cloud, what approaches make the best sense, what are the key things to plan for, what a logical application architecture looks like, and how you gradually transition from legacy workloads to cloud-native workloads in a controlled, low-risk way.

In for a Penny, In for a Pound: Private OpenStack vs Public Cloud”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The economic benefits of public cloud are touted by many as the reason to look at a migration away from internal datacenters, but what if this wasn’t actually fact?  Deploying an OpenStack based solution inside the datacenter can be as cost effective if not more effective than the large public cloud vendors.  The Open Software-Defined everything movement has allowed for storage, compute and networking to drop to pricepoints that have only been seen my the largest cloudscale vendors.  This session evaluates both the capital expenditures as well as the operating expenditures of traditional datacenter deployments, modern open source and software defined deployments and the public cloud, providing a virtual blueprint of where an enterprise could save costs and increase efficiencies by using each solution in the proper way.

OpenStack Consumption Models and Distribution Mechanisms (Distro is just one way!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While most consumers assume OpenStack Distribution is the only way to consume OpenStack, there are Five different ways one could consume OpenStack [1].- Distributions (commercial or not)- Appliances- Professional Service Providers- Hosted Private Cloud Service Providers- Public Cloud Service Providers Similarly, OpenStack is delivered through multiple ways, such as Distributions, Appliances or As-A-Service. In Austin Summit, the panel on Consumption Models [2] covered pros and cons of each consumption model. This talk builds on that panel session, by walking through each consumption model and distribution mechanism, along with best suited workloads for each model. Finally, this talk will provide basic TCO comparison of these models.

Snapdeal's Journey from Public to Hybrid Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

India's largest e-commerce marketplace, Snapdeal is migrating to a Hybrid cloud built on Openstack. India's growth story has been unprecedented lately fueled by the proliferation of smartphones. Snapdeal is at the center of this digital revolution being the largest e-commerce marketplace in the country. Snapdeal was born in the cloud, but public clouds stops being cost efficient after an inflection point. Last year we decided to build our own private cloud and in a short 10 months period we have successfully built our Hybrid cloud using 100% opensource, with Openstack being at the heart. Our cloud is spanned across 2 Datacenter regions, has highly dense compute architecture with 70000 cores, 10 PB of storage and a 100G SDN infrastructure. We are running on community release of Openstack Kilo customized for our needs. I'll share some of the choices that we have made & the key learnings during this phenomenal journey, followed by a quick demo of our hybrid capabilities.

The irrelevancy of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is irrelevant. Or it should be, by all means. And that is a good thing. A sign of maturity and evolution of the cloud platform that, unless you are in the boring business of delivering infrastructure, should always be considered as the means to an (service/application driven) end. In this session we will talk about what needs to be achieved before that final status of irrelevancy. The underlying cloud needs to be, in no particular order: Economic Resilient Reliable Scalable Flexible We will provide the audience with tips on architecture, design, cost models to get to an irrelevant openstack cloud as the first step to a successfull service rollout and operation.

100% Organic Talkshow Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Content Marketing in the OpenStack space is a tough calling. How do you produce technically deep (yet amusing), well-structured (and yet unexpected), workpersonlike (and yet whimsical) video programming for savvy, demanding, pretense-averse OpenStack viewers? The answer is … well, basically, Agile. You create structure and momentum by adopting ruthlessly minimalistic process, then improvise within that structure to create spontaneity and insight. That's the formula Nick Chase and colleague John Jainschigg, both of Mirantis, have used to create several dozen episodes of the OpenStack: Unlocked Podcast — a long-form video talk show featuring interviews of OpenStack industry visionaries. In this presentation, Nick and John discuss their process, techniques, and their 'expert-curated, crowdsourced' model for new content development, with an eye to helping other OpenStack communicators produce more useful content, faster, with less pain, strife, cost and self-doubt.

A dice with several faces: Coordinators, mentors and interns on OpenStack Outreachy internships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most open source projects do a poor job of onboarding new contributors. Proper onboarding enables a new contributor to make bigger contributions, more quickly, and increases how long they will stay involved. This process is especially challenging in open source and worldwide communities where different cultures collide. In this talk you will learn about the Outreachy program in OpenStack and how having a good mentor can help newcomers in overcoming the obstacles smoothly. This talk is intended for people willing to start contributing or mentoring and for those willing to become a better community member. In this presentation we will share the experience from one of the coordinators, one of the mentors and one on the interns of the last Outreachy round, hoping to clear doubts on how this kind of internships work, what is the added value to the community, what is expected from mentors and what is expected from mentees.

Are Bug Bashes Sexy? Productive?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It all started more than a year back in China with Intel and Huawei co-hosting a bug bash which morphed into a 3-day global bug bash for Mitaka running at 13 sites and local events for Newton. In India the event attracted OpenStack newcomers who were welcomed with 101 sessions. In China, Australia,  and USA seasoned PTLs and Cores hosted the events and teams focused on bugs in different areas, many of them critical, high, and medium in value. The sense of urgency from an impending release, the camaraderie of working together are special. Coupled with the stellar statistics in bugs addressed, fixed, reviewed, and merged shows a community that is vested in producing a quality product. We share in this talk the projects that benefitted and provide statistics on bugs addressed and resolved, tips on hosting a bug bash from how early to start, date selection, minimum requirements, places to advertise the event and more. Please consider hosting a bug bash for the next release!!

Data Analytics & Diversity in the OpenStack Projects - Sponsored by Women of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A popular talk in OpenStack Austin was about openstack contribution anslytics.  It shared the actual state of gender based technical contributions in OpenStack projects[1]. It spurred further questions from attendees on improving the accuracy of the numbers and extending the analysis to look for best practices in diversity. We will talk about best practices in OpenStack projects that make them more diverse. And this is also an issue for the organizations involved in the development of such projects. This talk will present an update of the numbers presented in Austin [1].   The analysis will focus on technical contributions (git and gerrit activity mainly) with a quantitative approach, but also add a qualitative approach to understand why the differences in terms of diversity within the Foundation exist.  [1] https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/8723

From Shanghai to Global - 2016 Bug Smash!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Starting the first China OpenStack Bug Smash at Shanghai, Intel and Huawei hosted two joint 3-day OpenStack Bug Smashes in 2015 which attracted big attention of developers from 8 key OpenStack vendors, achieved totally 147 bug fixes and 44 merges. Extending the model, in March and July 2016 we including a few community partners, such as Intel, Rackspace, Mirantis, IBM, Huawei, CESI and others worked together to host a global bug smash at a few sites across four continents, in order to collaborate round-the-clock, around the world, to fix as many bugs as possible across a wide range of OpenStack projects. In the process, we also help onboard and grow new OpenStack developers, and increase our collective knowledge of OpenStack tools and processes. The session is going to give the community and the summit attendees an update about the Bug Smash, and also encourages more and more organizers to join the events to make the activities fair to all.

Home and Away: A work from home episode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the UK, the number of people WFH has increased by a fifth in the last ten years. In the US, the number of people WFH has increased 103% since 2005. Technology enables us to communicate more-or-less solely online, eradicating the need for human interaction, and allowing us to WFH on the project we love. However, with all the benefits of WFH, it can also be isolating, lonely, difficult, and a struggle. As a documenter for OpenStack, the most important thing I do every day is communicate online with people I do not know to ensure my job is conducted effectively and efficiently. Communication online is key to creating, forming, and maintaining a successful project. This presentation will cover: Consideration for working with WFH colleagues when you work in an office How maintain effective online communication between team members How to use online communication to create a good team culture with your remote team Tips on how to work from efficiently and effectively

How can we study OpenStack well with your local user group members?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we would like to happily share meaningful lessons and tips learned from study team activities in Korea. There are more than about 5,000 people in OpenStack Korea User Group, and we had several seasonal study teams since March 2015. For about 1.5 years, approximately total 150 community members participated in offline study activities, and about 250 people joined in online slack channel to talk with study activities. We are now sure that more members in different local groups can more participate in their community activities through local study team activities. Moreover, organizing such activities needs additional ideas and thoughts such as to make balance with different study members, encourage participation, improve study satisfaction, and promote to upstream contribution. In this session, we will discuss how local user groups can make stronger and successful study teams with active members who are actively parcitipating in helping studies in Korean User Group.

How We Built Fuel Community: Challenges of Big Tent projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Big Tent made it much easier to add a new project into OpenStack ecosystem. But for the program itself to be alive and successful it’s very important to build a community of developers and users around it. We at Mirantis like anyone else know how difficult it is to build a community around a Big Tent project.  We are core contributors to Fuel.  And from the project that only Mirantis was contributing to, Fuel became a 3rd popular deployment tool with a pretty large ecosystem of Fuel plugins (over 60 of them on github). In this presentation we are going to share our journey, summarize the lessons that we learned while we were building a community around Fuel and present a cheat shit of things that in our opinion is very importnant to take into account when you start building a community project.  


* **Evgeniya Shumakher** *(Evgeniya Shumakher is Senior Manager of Technology Partnerships and Alliances at Mirantis, where she coordinates and leads efforts to help Mirantis partners navigate the OpenStack ecosystem, and to expand the utility of Mirantis OpenStack to customers via integration of partner products and technologies.)*

Lesson learned from organizing developer teams in user group: how to help each other.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are more than about 5,000 people registered at Korea community. Among them, not many people can develop or have an experience of operating OpenStack. It is really difficult to keep openstack developers' passion and activity in community (outside of company's work). In addition, as a developers in Korea, I often felt difficulties to participate openstack developer community due to the language barrier, time differences, cultural difficulties to share information outside of company, etc. Thus, we thought a developer meetup is great idea to follow up. As a result, Korea community is running developer meetups for 6 month now. We did write specs, analyzed code, tested new project, etc. all together. It created real momentum among developers to continue its road to openstack developers, as well as motivated them to share with others. We will share our experiences to run this developer-focused meetups.

Making Meetup Magic: Growing the OpenStack Community Through Local Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Cloud Computing is much more than technology. It’s a community. And our community wasn’t built by accident! Building and growing this amazing group has been a result of the very deliberate efforts of some extremely dedicated people, as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, IRC, Stack Overflow, Google Hangout, and Twitter. Great OpenStack meetups are powerful. They foster a collaborative, inclusive environment, focused on important issues to the developers and users who make OpenStack tick.  In this continuation of a talk that began at OpenStack Summit Austin, hear what’s made four of the leading meetup organizers in the U.S. so successful and how you can translate that success to your local meetups. They’ll cover the logistics of having sponsors as speakers, explore the pros and cons of streaming live meetups, talk about how to diversify our community, and answer all of your burning questions.

Meetups and User Groups: How Cross-Pollination of Communities Leads to Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ansible, an open source project frequently used with OpenStack, is known (amongst other reasons) for its rapid growth as a community. With more than 17,000 stars on GitHub, and over 180 meetup groups around the world, it's pretty easy to find someone you know who likes Ansible! But at some point, growing the attendance or potential audience of any user or meetup group can be difficult, and can be even tougher in smaller or less densely populated cities. And ensuring that meetups grow and evolve is key to their ongoing success -- and ultimately, part of the project's success. The Ansible community has discovered successes in locating and finding other meetup groups in which to branch out - including OpenStack meetups! In this session, Robyn Bergeron, Community Architect for Ansible, will share some of her lessons learned in growing and cross-pollination of the Ansible community with other communities. 


* **Robyn Bergeron** *(As Ansible's Community Architect, Robyn Bergeron focuses on building bridges between Ansible and other open source communities, as well as steadily scaling Ansible's framework for collaboration and contribution as the community continues to grow.

Open Source and Cultural aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Communities involve a group of people, but what if those people have different upbring and think differently about how to approach and solve problems? Open Source projects face this every day, but usually, depending on the size of the project, some of these aspects go unnoticed... or even ignored. For large-scale projects, this affects participation and how to get people involved. Luckily there are ways to deal with this... In this presentation an overview is given about aspects that can influence the participation level. Examples are given from different perspectives. Also, solutions are given that have helped projects like OpenStack and Fedora to deal with them.

OpenStack BugSmash: Improving OpenStack and engaging new developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack became the largest open source project in the world because of a large and diverse developer community. With the maturity of the foundational projects, and a clear development methodology, it's getting even easier to learn how to contribute. So what's the fastest way to get involved? Take part in a global OpenStack BugSmash! This past spring, the OpenStack community ran coordinated BugSmash days during the first week of March in several locations around the world. This event brought experienced OpenStack committers together with community members, students, and others that were new to OpenStack or wanted to learn more. At our satellite event in New York City, it resulted in the participation of 28 local and remote attendees from 11 organizations to review and fix 51 bugs. It also generated 8 technical videos recorded for posterity. We also designed the logo, t-shirts, and stickers for the global event. Learn what worked well and what we would do better next time.

Raising the awareness on diversity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Why diversity is important even if you are male, white, and even if you are old? It took me some time to understand that diversity was a really an important topic. At first, I did not understand that. I was absolutely not aware that there was a problem. The fact that we were all male, white, between 35 to 45 (it was some time ago) to make decisions seemed perfectly ok. In this session, I would like to highlight why it's important, when and why I became aware of that aspect, and how we can raise the awareness among our peers.

Adaptive Monitoring and Auto-recovery of Openstack services in kolla
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kolla is helping to make each service running independently.when some container killed, currently there is a difficulty in getting the status of the service and container and manual intervention required to start the container which creates a downtime in the whole clusterThere is 3 ways we can monitor the kolla services1. Reactive:This kind of monitoring can be achived by the orchestration engine updates the monitoring system2. Proactive:This kind of monitoring can be achived by adding precautionary measures for the known issues, where, if the issue occurs it immidiately starts the precaution to eradicate the fault.3. Adaptive:This is better suited for monitoring a frequently changing system like docker containers, as it can adapt itself to the micro services that get intorduced into the containers. Now the question is “Is the adaptive montoring a full solution to the abovementioned challenges?"- We need solutions at different levels of openstack services and containers and hypervisor

Best practices for using containers to simulate Computes for scalability testing  of Openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scalability testing of OpenStack require huge number of baremetal computes.Addition of more bare metal computes for meeting increased simulation demands is redundant in the long run.A cheap alternative required to do control path testing and data path testing . Docker containers can help in simulating computes : 1. Using a single baremetal server , user can create 100+ containers2. Each of these containers is used to simulate compute nodes by installing required openstack components/services on it.3. On simulated computes lightweight VMs are spawned4. Effectively we can create 100+ computes using a single baremetal server. This session will present following: 1. How one can use Docker containers to simulate computes.2. Using this environment, test the scalability limit of cloud infrastructure 3. Using this environment, perform VM lifecycle operations.4. Test datapath of simulated VMs

Beyond Neutron: all you wanted to know about container networking but were too afraid to ask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack users, we are all familiar with Neutron and how it handles networking for our virtual machines. But in a world where an important part of our workloads are being moved to microservices running on containers, how can we efficiently handle secure and high-performance networking for these containers? And how do those containers communicate with the rest of the OpenStack cloud and the outside world? Is there a way to connect both worlds, and does it make sense at all to connect them? This session will address how the currently available solutions for container networking intersect with the OpenStack Neutron networking model. It will also present several open-source and commercial networking solutions for containers and discuss how they work in OpenStack, and inside Container Orchestration environments such as Mesos, DC/OS, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes. Finally, we will show a demo of how networking works both in an OpenStack and a Container environment.

Building Immutable LXD Container Images from Scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Linux container images traditionally include system services and utilities that are not always needed or desired by application developers.  Ideally, containers should only have the files and executables actually needed by the application.  This apporach reduces the size of the container images significantly, as well as reducing the need to patch unused software for bug and security fixes.  LXD is a system level container that provides features not typically found in other application-oriented containers.  The nova-lxd compute driver enables organizations to run LXD system containers on bare metal in an OpenStack cloud, instead of using nested virtualization inside of instances.In this presentation, I plan to present how to build a minimal LXD container image from scratch that can execute an application in an OpenStack cloud.  This minimal application image will be built from distribution-provided packages and automated with Ansible, allowing for ease of use and repeatability.

Cinder, Manila, Kolla, Docker: The challenges and opportunities of deploying OpenStack on Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a highly distributed platform consisting of multiple services, each with their own software dependency stack. Managing the lifecycle (from deployment through update and upgrade) of these services along with their dependencies poses interesting challenges - even more so when you need to ensure desired availability for these services. One way to deal with these challenges is by containerizing OpenStack services. This can not only simplify deployment, scaling, and updates, but also allow the operator to deal with each service as a discrete unit. The Kolla Project provides the necessary tools to simplify deployment and orchestration of OpenStack services on containers. Manila's new container driver also enables us to exploit a Docker container as a share server instead of a virtual machine.  In this session, we'll discuss the advantages and challenges of deploying OpenStack on containers and how the approach impacts OpenStack Cinder and Manila.

Container as first class citizens of OpenStack and across multiple OpenStacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud-native applications, (Applications or Services that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled and micro-services oriented), currently is a phrase that sums up where a lot of enterprise developers and operations staff think they are headed. To close the gap between OpenStack and "cloud-native applications", we make efforts on Networking, Storage, and Authorization/Authentication to make containers "first-class citizen". We use Kuryr to connect containers network with Neutron; we use Fuxi to allow containers use Cinder volumes. For the popular container platform Kubernetes, we make use of Keystone to be Authorization/Authentication provider for container clusters integrated with OpenStack IaaS, to support Multi-tenant scenarios. In this presentation, we will also show how Tricircle project, which aims to provide an OpenStack API gateway and networking automation, can help build container network and provision container storages across mutiple OpenStack instances.

Container Orchestration Tapas: Kubernetes, Murano, Magnum and Swarm on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many organizations looking to adopt containers to increase speed for their developers have found OpenStack to be their path to production because OpenStack provides a single platform and set of APIs for virtual machines, bare metal, and containers. Containers are a hot commodity for developers these days but orchestration is where containerized application can reach production grade.  On the other hand, developers have always been told to ignore the underlying infrastructure when moving to the cloud, so the question here is, why should they care about the container orchestrator? The answer is that developers still need to be able to deploy at least a basic architecture to build and test, so it's important to make things as simple as possible.  Fortunately, OpenStack provides multiple easy-to-use options such as Murano and Magnum, and we're going to look at -- and demo! -- them in this session.

Containers in the Enterprise: Are We There Yet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn how containers can empower software developers to unlock new value for your enterprise. For enterprises, implementing containers and container cluster management is all about giving application developers a more agile, responsive and efficient cloud infrastructure. For cloud operators, however, delivering that infrastructure is a big departure from the days of VMs. This presentation will give the audience greater insights into: what the adoption curve looks like for containers in the enterprise benefits CIOs can realize—versus the risks—from jumping in now rather than waiting how VMs and containers might—or might not—work in tandem to achieve agile infrastructure goals how OpenStack and Kubernetes can deliver VMs and containers via one control plane how terms like “enterprise ready” can be loaded and unhelpful what new tools are emerging to help agile infra operators deliver the service levels and security that app devs need

Containers without Chaos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container technology is gaining traction within the OpenStack community. While one of the goals is to make developers’ lives easier, containers alone won’t solve development and deployment issues. Having a strong and automated tool set for service discovery, networking, and load balancing are critical when your applications need to scale. In this presentation, we will share best practices for service discovery and registration in your OpenStack environment – a complex task. We’ll demonstrate how to implement these practices with NGINX, the top software-based application delivery platform available today, and the most downloaded application on Docker Hub. We’ll also cover multiple methods of automating load balancing and service discovery to take advantage of available open source solutions.

Converging QEMU and TCMU for Container Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers storage technologies are changing rapidly. Volume Plugins in Docker and Kubernetes open doors to 3rd party storage provisioning for containers. However, these technologies are all based on bind-mount, volume drivers have to implement storage functionalities on their own. On the other hand, QEMU has a different approach to provide storage for virtual machines. QEMU's block drivers abstracts different backend storage types and thus supports features like multi-tenancy, snapshot, and QoS, which are currently missing in Container storage drivers. This talk presents a new technology that converges QEMU and TCMU. This allows Containers to use rich storage features that are already available to Virtual Machines. This technology integrates QEMU's block layer with tcmu-runner, and enables Containers to access various storage backends and rich storage features.

Converting a traditional app to containers: how CrowdStar built an effective ecosystem on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, mobile game developer CrowdStar will explain how and why they moved toward containers after switching to an OpenStack infrastructure provider, how refactoring a monolithic application to micro-services can be a challenge and the benefits that they hope to achieve by leveraging containers. They will also outline how they chose the best tools for the job (i.e. Kubernetes, Rancher, Prometheus) and how they stitched them together to orchestrate this containerized environment. This talk is full of practical, actionable information based on almost two years of experimentation, and solutions found to the most common challenges (including CI / CD) currently faced by DevOps departments seeking to refactor apps. Finally, Internap will lift the hood on adapting an existing OpenStack cloud to facilitate customer application containerization and operation.

Curbing Container Confusion: what you need to know to use the term Containers responsibly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Everyone can agree that Containers is a hot topic.  Unfortunately, when most people talk about "Containers", they are actually talking about different things.  In OpenStack this leads to misleading statements like "Nova can't orchestrate containers" and "Magnum is our container orchestration system" (meaning what is this Zun thing?).  The truth is that OpenStack has no generic container component because anything that makes use of the Linux Containers API is a container.  This means that when most people talk about "containers" they actually mean a particular way their container is built and most likely they mean the container platform (like Docker, Rkt, LXC etc).  The talk will explain what the differences between all these platforms are, and why they need to be different (and why OpenStack actually doesn't need a generic container component).  We will also address the prevailing impression that this is all just a format problem and OCI will sort it all out (it isn't and it won't).

Deploy container clusters on baremetal with tenants isolated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Docker and Containers are taking the application development world by storm, but with all of their benefits there are some limitations and challenges. One key challenge is security between containers, especially when those containers are in different security zones. In areas like Financial Services and Medical Records, companies have widely different security requirements. Today there are no solutions within the Docker ecosystem to fulfill those security requirements while maintaining performance and scale. We will demonstrate a solution to this problem using OpenStack Magnum, Ironic integration, and Neutron Networking with networking-generic-switch plugin. This solution uses: – A Neutron extension to provision ports on generic switch – An Ironic extension to coordinate the port provisioning – Magnum to deploy the container clusters This allows deployment of secure, flexible, scalable bare-metal clusters.

Dev and Ops - Separate Islands No More!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Bringing the power of infrastructure to applications by bridging the gaps between Developers and Operations. Application intent can be communicated to infrastructure for better reliability and performance. The key is to make infrastructure, and application intent policies available for developers to consume in an easy and seamless way. In this session we will share how we are leveraging OpenStack and other completely open source and vendor neutral technologies, that enable developers to attach application intent for infrastructure to provide optimized treatment.  Using OpenStack Magnum, we will deploy Docker containerized applications on kubernetes scheduler with application intent and other operational policies enforcement via project Contiv.

Docker Container overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Docker Engine: The Docker engine is for enabling the realization of purpose-specific as well as generic Docker containers Docker engine is analogus to a KVM in the virtual machine world. It allows the container virtualization at the OS level Docker container: the read-write layer is the container layer, Docker pulls the required image and its parent image. It continues to pull all the parent images until it reaches the base image. Docker Registry: A service responsible for hosting and distributing images. The default registry is the Docker Hub. Docker Repository: A collection of related images (usually providing different versions of the same application or service).

Elevating Magnum to Production with Cinder and Manila Persistence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Modern applications are using more and more data, which makes doing rapid development and testing with those data sets difficult and expensive.  For organizations which want to transition to using containers for dev, test, or even production, the prospect of migrating data from Cinder or Manila volumes into something perceived to be more container friendly is daunting.  However, the container orchestrators managed by Magnum, Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos, can all take advantage of those volumes directly using the Docker Volume Plugin paradigm. This session will explore how to clone Cinder and Manila volumes, introduce them to the orchestration platforms, and integrate them using the native persistent storage mechanisms for each orchestrator.  This drastically simplifies the process of dev and test for large data sets when the application is run in containers, and further removes barriers to transitioning to Docker for cloud native applications.

Enabling Application Delivery with Kubernetes and OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing a container-centric approach to infrastructure. It offers developers a way to deploy applications quickly and predictably be it locally, in a public or private cloud, or even across multiple clouds. Kubernetes is in the process of evolving to take better advantage of the facilities provided by OpenStack clouds to provide an ideal platform for modern containerized applications while the applications  themselves remain infrastructure agnostic.

Hypernetes: Secure & Multi-tenant Kubernetes Enabled by OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Hypernetes aims at managing hypervisor-based containers with Kubernetes. Instead of running k8s on OpenStack, Hypernetes directly launch HyperContainer as k8s container runtime, then build a production ready solution with Keystone for multi-tenancy, Neutron for container network, and Cinder for container persistent volume. This is a much easier way integrate k8s with OpenStack, and joins both good parts of VMs and containers so it can provide secure and multi-tenant container cloud without wrapping them inside VMs. This presentation will also demo the Kubernetes official project Frakti which aims at using hypervisor as first class container runtime, how OpenStack core components serve container network and persistent volume. Today, many developers are not comfortable with Linux containers as an effective boundary, and requires for a stronger degree of isolation, particularly for those running in a multi-tenant environment. We believe this solution is one of the best answers.

Kubernetes SDN Performance and Architecture Evaluation at Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Over last year Kubernetes has become similar platform for containers as OpenStack in virtual machines. We spent last 6 month of running Kubernetes for microservices applications as well as for OpenStack itself. We containerazed whole OpenStack including libvirt for more than 100 compute nodes. We discover that networking is one of the most challenging aspects to running Kubernetes. Therefore over the last month, tcp cloud has run extensive performance and diagnostics tests across multiple overlay providers (OpenContrail, Calico, Romana, etc.) as well as against the base Kubernetes Flannel configurations and have come to several insights into CPU penalties. Network design issues at scale as well as performance comparisons use different encapsulation techniques. We deployed Kubernetes cluster on 300 physical servers!

Kuryr's goal is to make Neutron networking available to containers in their most widespread usages.Kuryr bridges the gap between the container orchestration engines like Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos and the OpenStack networking. It exposes all of the production grade Neutron capabilities and services to large scale container consumers. In Mitaka we presented our plans for Kubernetes integration and nested containers; for Newton we are enriching these enviorments with OpenStack advanced services such as Security Groups and Load Balancers. We show how a seamless set of advanced networking services and policies for containers, VMs, bare metal and nested containers can be provided by leveraging Kuryr with OpenStack.

Load Balancing Containers in Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes simplify deployment and management of containerized applications across a cluster of machines. The OpenStack community has embraced Kubernetes with projects like Magnum. One key part of any high-performance web application is load balancing. Kubernetes provides built-in support for TCP/UDP load balancing and provides the Ingress resource to configure HTTP load balancers. This resource, however, covers only simple use cases, which leaves users on their own when applications need to support advanced use cases such as WebSocket, extended content-based routing, session persistence, etc. NGINX is a high-performance open source load balancer as well as a content cache and web server. The fact that it is lightweight and highly scalable makes it a great load balancing solution for Kubernetes, and explains why community members are embracing this solution for their containerized applications.

Magnum and Ironic Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running containers on bare metal hosts is of interest to some use cases and workloads.   We have integrated Magnum with Ironic for our internal project.   During this integration, we encountered Nova scheduling race condition that slowed down the provisioning.  We also found limitation on current Magnum bay model which restricts our choices for hardware.   In this talk, we will share how we integrated Magnum with Ironic, what Ironic features such as node inspection and secure boot that we used to automate configuration and provisioning of Magnum bay for Kubernetes cluster, what issues and what Magnum bay model limitation we have encountered, and the enhancement blueprints that we have submitted.  We will also talk about Ironic features which are still work in progress that will enhance Magnum and Ironic integration.  Lastly, we will give a demo of this work.

Magnum is not the OpenStack Containers service? How about Zun?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers are hot. Everyone love them. OpenStack is undergoing a continuous evolution toward full-edged container support. Currently there are various projects which try to enable containers on Openstack like Nova-docker, Murano, Heat etc., but none of them have been proven to be the perfect solution. Magnum aimed to make containers available as first class resource in Openstack but went in a different direction recently. In the Austin summit, the Magnum community decided to limit the scope to the management of Container Orchestration Engines and leave the management of containers to a new project which is now called Zun. In this session, we will brief the recent change of Magnum mission statement. Then, we will introduce the Zun project, its targeted use cases, and the rationales to create this project. We will also welcome use cases, ideas from attendees if any.

Monitoring Kubernetes with Monasca
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Considering the constantly increasing amount of applications running in containers, providing a reliable and efficiently operable container infrastructure is crucial – in particular at scale. Running Kubernetes, an opensource-system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications, on-top of OpenStack have been proven a popular option for container management. The draw-back of this approach was the missing operational link between OpenStack and Kubernetes.In this session we show how Kuberntes run on OpenStack can be comfortably monitored with Monasca (OpenStack Monitoring as a Service). Furthermore we explain how the gained insights can be utilized for operations like alerting, log management and node auto-scaling.In our scenario Monasca is used as the Storage Backend for metrics coming from Heapster and for pod logs. We levarege Monasca alerting functionality to trigger the auto-scaling with Heat. Finally, we will give a demo of our solution.

Multi-tenancy and advanced networking for containers in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In our previous OpenStack Summit talk, we showed how Kubernetes and Swarm containers can be hosted efficiently on the same OpenStack infrastructure through Mesos.  Even better efficiency can be achieved with multi-tenancy on the same cluster, allowing resources to be shared among containers from multiple tenants in a flexible manner.  Multi-tenancy does introduce new requirements on the infrastructure and management software, such as name space and advanced networking to isolate containers from different tenants. In this talk, we will explore the issues in providing multi-tenancy for containers and show how this can be achieved on OpenStack. The end result is an environment on OpenStack that can host Kubernetes and Swarm containers from multiple tenants.

Networking considered the Achilles heel of container clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the popularity of containers increases, several alternatives for supporting these in OpenStack clouds are emerging. However, given the much higher instance (per hypervisor) density found in real-world production clouds for containers, the usual virtual networking implementations - successfully applied to VMs in the past - have become an Achilles heel. In this talk we present several relevant alternatives, focusing on the networking aspects of each solution. In particular, we present the networking models used with multiple instance management options, such as Nova (nova-docker), Magnum, and Kuryr  (and possibly Zun) projects. We consider all existing container networking solutions from the Docker Container Network Model to the AppC Container Network Interface, and their interaction with OpenStack Neutron. We evaluate and quantify the performance and scalability of the networking alternatives.

OpenStack is an Application! Deploy and Manage Your Stack with Kolla-Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack consists of interrelated software components that control hardware pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter that are difficult to install, manage, and upgrade. With Kubernetes, each of the services can be viewed as applications.  Combined, they form a complex application that Kubernetes is capable of managing. Kubernetes provides high-level abstractions built around the needs of complex production systems like OpenStack. This provides an alternative approach to operations enabling clusters to be more easily operated, managed, and automated. In addition, Kubernetes has native tooling which simplifies otherwise hard problems like HA or upgrades. In this talk, the kolla-k8s team will demonstrate how Kubernetes solves the "Day 1" problem of deployment as well as "Day 2" operations like configuration, reconfiguration, failure recovery, and upgrades.  We will also demonstrate a production ready, highly available OpenStack based on kolla-k8s.

Policy-based Kubernetes Scheduling driven by Congress, OPA, Magnum, and the rest of the BigTent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

 In this talk we describe how OpenStack Congress, the recent open-source project Open Policy Agent (OPA), and Magnum work together to give an OpenStack operator the ability dynamically control the container placement logic of Kubernetes by writing rich, declarative policy statements.  As a first use case, we demonstrate policies where Kubernetes pods need to be scheduled so they have local access to Cinder-backed storage.  Importantly, this integration is accomplished with NO changes to Magnum or Cinder; the exact same integration works to implement policies that draw on data from any (combination) of the BigTent projects.

Put a Lid on It! Secure Kubernetes Container Workloads with Production-Grade Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container orchestration engines like Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos highlight the importance of network security that scales with growing deployments. With Cloud Native applications built by composing microservices, the ability to control traffic as it flows among these services becomes critical.  The Kubernetes Network SIG worked over last year to define Network Policy with the ability to control traffic among containerized services. At the same time, open source projects Kuryr and MidoNet have been advancing to achieve network security for containers in a simplified, distributed architecture. Removing architectural bottlenecks, Kuryr + MidoNet efficiently implement security policies through the hardened Neutron framework for use by containers in large scale environments. In this talk, we will discuss the latest updates of the Kubernetes Network SIG group, insert Neutron as a networking framework, and explore Kuryr and MidoNet networking solutions with advanced use cases.

rkt, runC, LXC: How are we running containers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers have become the new hot topic in the last few years. This is not the least reason why we now have multiple container runtimes. A container runtime is simply the low-level engine hiding behind all of the fancy commands we use to run a container. Usually the runtimes job is done silently in the background. A few years ago there were only very few feature-rich container runtime implementations. Now we have multiple and all promise to be both easy to use, feature-rich and secure by default. In this talk we will try to bridge the gap between a higher-level and a low-level view on what different container runtimes do. We will try to answer what they have in common and where they differ.

Self Healing Cloud: Predictive Analysis before it cost you time and money
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data center is far more complex today than it was a decade ago. The traditional “set and forget” approach to backup and recovery is no longer relevant. New challenges demand new approaches, one of which is the use of analytics to increase the value that backup and recovery provides your business. Self-Healing: for automatic repair or re-provisioning of new resources when a stack becomes unhealthy or a resource is not performing as expected. Integration of OpenStack with Kubernetes has built in self-healing mechanisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling, and replicating containers. As a user, you just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met at all times on the cluster. We’ve all had issues troubleshooting OpenStack services, whether it’s in the pre-build architecture or post build service failure.

The Combinations between Containers and Openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Container technologies have gained significant popularity in the last a few years, and several projects attempt to combine container technologies with OpenStack to address different problems such as multi-tenancy, resource management, monitoring, network, storage, and more. In this session, we will talk about the trend of Containers and OpanStack, such as containers on OpenStack and OpenStack in Containers. We will give a brief introduction to various container-focused projects/sub-projects such as Magnum, Kolla, Kuryr, Murano, nova-docker, nova-lxc, nova-lxd. Then, we will highlight the new container project, called Zun. We will explain the rationales to create this project, and emphasize the use cases this project aims to address. Finally, we will do a comparison of the projects above and explain how these projects will help users run containerized workloads on OpenStack.

Toward 10,000's containers on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos have been shown to scale to hundreds orthousands of nodes and tens of thousands of containers, handlingmillions of requests per second. On OpenStack, they can be easilydeployed and managed by Magnum, but how do they scale? Building thecorrect infrastructure plays a critical role in the performance andscalability for the containers, and this needs to be implemented in Magnum.Working toward this goal, we have built a collection of Rally plugins totrack the performance and scalability of both Magnum and the ContainerOrchestration Engines (Kubernetes, Swarms, Mesos). We have been runningthe benchmarks on large OpenStack environments to collect measurementsand study the behavior of the system. In this talk, we will present ourfindings along with some of the best practices we found for operatinglarge container environments.

Unified application model for VMs and containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As containers become as popular for enterprise workloads as VM instances, there is an emergent need to provide a unified application development paradigm across both domains. In this talk, we describe how we achieved this by creating a new kubernetes driver for Nova. This driver is provided with the kubeconfig for the given Kubernetes cluster during initialization. During instance provisioning, it automatically converts the given Glance image into a docker image. The cloud-init customization scripts are injected into the docker image to be run on startup. The driver deploys a single service targeting a single pod when creating an instance, with a replication controller of just 1 replica. Heat was also modified by adding another parameter to the AutoScalingGroup - the kubeconfig. When this parameter is present, Heat creates an appropriate ReplicationController for the instances instead. Finally,we demonstrate the use of the same Heat template to deploy a VM or container based workload.

WAN Optimization using Docker Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

WAN optimization solutions such as Cisco® Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) have increasingly emerged as primary IT tools that organizations use to provide application acceleration, WAN bandwidth compression, and local hosting of branch-office IT services. Benefits of WAN optimization include 1. Increased user productivity while accessing centralized applications 2. Consolidation of branch servers & storage 3. Deferral of WAN bandwidth upgrade costs, and a reduced branch-office hardware footprint. Network latency over the WAN is the fundamental reason why applications perform poorly when delivered from the data center to the branch office. We attempt to negate the extra hops between VNFs in a service chain by localizing the operations, running them in containers.

What happens when DC/OS meets OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Mesosphere Open DC/OS treats container as first class citizen, supporting container image for AppC, Docker, Linux container with OCI being planned for the near future.  Until recently, automated deployment for DC/OS is only available on AWS and Azure, but with a new bay driver in Magnum, users can now manage their DC/OS cluster in OpenStack. This brings several benefits: 1) Open DC/OS easily available in a private cloud, allowing full customization of the cluster. 2) Dynamic scaling of the cluster infrastructure 3) Advanced coordination between container auto scaling and cluster infrastructure auto scaling. In this talk, we will show how Magnum deploys and manages the DC/OS cluster in OpenStack.  We will also describe advanced support for DC/OS with storage through Docker volume driver and networking through CNI.

Why Openstack is the platform of choice for hosting your Container Orchestration Engine.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every company starting to look at a platform for their new agile project face the same questions, should i buy a PaaS or should i build a CaaS. If they chose to build, then they must chose the right Orchestration engine and once again choices made so far often makes reversibility harder. Fortunately Openstack is already a plateform of choice for PaaS and CaaS. Let's demonstrate how Openstack Magnum will help you to adress your CaaS requirements from POC to production.

3 Peas in a POD – Accelerating Time to Value with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

To help promote the adoption of OpenStack and Private Cloud deployments, Intel created a sales tool called the SDI POD (Proof of Deployment) program. We consistently heard from our customers that they have seen our SDI OpenStack slideware before. They wanted proof that OpenStack was real and delivered the value we promised. We put our heads together and came up with a set of tools both hardware and software that demonstrates the power of OpenStack to our customers. In this session you will see how our “carry on”, “Cloud in a box” PODs (both Intel NUC, Xeon-D, and Xeon-E5 based) have been utilized to train, demonstrate, and prove the power of OpenStack. In conjunction with Cookbooks and Recipes,the value of the SDI POD program is the ability to show real business use cases running on OpenStack deployments. The SDI POD program helps accelerate the adoption of OpenStack by breaking down the “barriers of acceptance”, common in many organizations.

Advanced Cloud Technology is here so look at People and Processes for Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sometimes it seems easy to implement a technical solution. IT gets a new project and eventually the business gets a new solution. Today we have the technology to deploy assets in seconds to minutes instead of days, weeks, and months; this means that business can be more innovative and have much greater market entry velocity than ever before. This all sounds great but even though the technology exists, that doesn’t mean that the business is designed to really take advantage of it and neither is IT usually.  The crux of the issue isn’t around technology; it is People and Process.  First off, the culture of the organization has to be ready for innovation at cloud-speed. Second, IT roles and skills need to be aligned with cloud capabilities and not with old time legacy latency. Third is Process, say this word over and over and it is still not enough because process defines automation  and orchestration, which is the cornerstone of cloud computing.

AT&T's Upstream Journey: Open Source within a Fortune 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T has seen an increase of 54x in commits, 10x in reviews, and 14x in drafted blueprints. Well over half of all contributions have come from a group consisting mostly of new hires. This effort began with three engineers and has since grown to thirty dedicated members in the first half of 2016. Most notably, these results have occurred within the walls of a Fortune 10, historically associated with conservative decisions rather than open source dedication. There is an absolute tide turning in the software culture at AT&T from all levels and it is to that of openness. The presenters in this talk are the original members of AT&T’s Community team. We have gone from fresh OpenStackers to taking on all steps required to contribute and grow the team by ten-fold. We have run the gambit on changing culture and breaking down roadblocks to enable open source efforts. We still have a long way to go, but we know our results and experiences can be invaluable to others in the community.

Does your voice count in OpenStack? Yes!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Working upstream and downstream is not easy. The upstream work can sometime make us lose the focus that we should always have on solving real user problems. In this talk we will cover how we slightly changed the way Red Hat’s OpenStack engineering teams, by including customer’s voice in a process.  Contributions are now part of an end-to-end delivery split of the work, cutting across traditional organizational lines. We use an approach similar to The Voice of the Customer (VOC) to capture customers’ requirements that are organized, sequenced in terms of relative importance and satisfaction with current alternatives. We will cover in detail, how we are encouraging the contributors to look at the product we are building, and the process we are using to build the product, while they are listening to the customer's voice, as if they were just behind them looking over their shoulders.

From OpenStack Rookie to OpenStack Rockstar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Do you have a multi-tiered organization in need of OpenStack training? Are your OpenStack skills disproportionately concentrated within a single team? Are you having trouble educating your product and sales teams on OpenStack and open source technologies? If so, then this session is for you. Join us as we take you through the lessons we learned from our mission to bring OpenStack skills to a wide variety of teams across multiple geographies inside of IBM. We will show you how we created a scalable and customizable education model that includes hands on access to test environments to address the needs of those who will engage customers in pre-sale activity, those who will consume the technology as they develop cloud solutions, and those who will develop code and contribute back into the community. This approach has helped us educate nearly 300 IBMers internally at a predictable cost per student, and resulted in 10,000 lines of code contributed externally.

How to lose clients and alienate coworkers - lessons learned on an OpenStack enterprise journey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It's not a smooth road to getting customers and developers to OpenStack. This session focuses on the missteps and the maybe next times, such as: How not to introduce OpenStack to your existing customers. Enterprises are sometimes shy about changing the paradigm by which they manage their core computing resources. Migration, security, long-term plans are all important. Making your team hate developing in the open. Devs who worked on proprietary systems don't always embrace the open source ethos. How do you get them to create blueprints, love IRC and go to conferences? Not playing nicely with the community. The community doesn't seem to appreciate hearing about how a platform brings in millions of dollars in revenue and has decades of history. Is there a way to share experiences between the enterprise and open dev communities to benefit both? Learn about how to use humility and cooperation to fix things with the community, make your team stronger, and your customers more productive.

Inside the Developer Persona: What are they thinking?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It’s a question all of us in the business of marketing OpenStack ask ourselves: How do we win over the developers? Not the OpenStack developers, but the developers at our target companies. The ones who have nothing to do with OpenStack. We want them to advocate for OpenStack-based (presumably private) cloud solutions—to win over the decision-makers in their respective IT organizations. But is that realistic? Do they care what clouds their companies use? What do they know about OpenStack? Where do they get their information? Are they so comfortable with the major public cloud offerings that they’re going to resist any kind of change at all? Are we just spinning our wheels trying to communicate with them? In this session, Ali Amagasu, OpenStack marketer for Cisco Systems (and previously Metacloud) will ask a panel of developers all those questions and more in an effort to figure out what they need, whether we can give it to them, and how we should go about communicating it.

Let’s make the work place more diverse! How to hire a more diverse team for success.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When we talk about the benefits of diversity, we frequently cite studies of companies like the 2009 UIC study concluding racial and gender diversity are associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, and greater relative profits.  A panel of company people leaders will bring this conversation down from the macro scale to discuss their personal experiences where building a diverse team has positively impacted product delivery and contributed to success.  These strong leaders will give advice on successfully finding and hiring talent to create a diverse team.  A report published in the Oct 2010 Science magazine showed a greater proportion of women in a group was associated with higher collective intelligence, defined as “the general ability of a group to perform a wide variety of tasks.”    Is it better to intentionally seek out and hire women to raise a team’s collective intelligence, or should diversity be encouraged organically by working to reduce bias in hiring?

Making Open Source Mode Accessible.... One Women's T-shirt at a Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The number of women involved in open source technologies has increased slightly in the last decade, but clearly not enough to drive longer lines at the women’s restrooms or increase the distribution of women’s T-shirts at today’s popular open source events. In this session, Johanna Koester, Program Director of Open Technology and Amy Hermes, Program Director of Technical Eminence at IBM, share best practices and lessons learned around making open source more accessible to women. Open source organizations, IT vendors and end users alike will benefit from a deeper understanding of what it takes to increase not only the number of women in technology but also the level of engagement of women across organizations and ecosystems. Learn what should become the “meets min” from open source foundations, organizations where you work and companies you interact with… including that “right-sized” T-shirt!

Metrics: Friends or Enemies?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Measuring progress, effectiveness and success is a key in every organization from software development to services. The metrics are the same, and as always the devil is in the details. In an open source environment the different actors need to use the same set of numbers to form a meaningful set of KPIs. As the traditional processes and ways of working go through a transformation period to adjust to open source methods, it is crucial to have the same changes applied to metrics and how they are used to get the proper feedback loop. This presentation will go through the existing tools that provide measurements and describe the meaning of each. The presentation will also give an overview on how to use the values in an efficient way to become drivers of both business and development as opposed to a numbers' game.

OpenStack integration proccess to super conservatives: case of social infrastructure corporation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Adoptation of OpenStack by super conservatives is the most difficult case. Super conservative company has complex business process, very sensitive to system reliability, hates confusion generated by changes and for the most they have the history of operating own systems in a closed environment. Thus, making a decision of adopting Openstack have to overcome barrier within the organization. In order for those companies to adopt Openstack, it is crucial to change the conservative mind set of their corporate culture to be more open minded. In this session, I would like to share the challenges which we facing right now on how to start and induce cultural shift in an organization, and also discuss methodologies and approaches which we are taking so far.I believe that our experience has larger benefit for many Stackers.And I hope exchanging information and sharing problems through our discussion contributes to a growth of Openstack World.

OpenStack Operations by Design: An Approach to Integrated Operational Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many paths to the Cloud. Open projects and commercial distributions look at how to automate deployment and configuration of not only OpenStack but also DevOps tools to help with operations. In this session we propose the formation of an open cooperative project to offer a consistent way to extend OpenStack with tools that fulfil Operational capabilities & interfaces. It would cater to growing community of OpenStack operators worldwide and give them a common vehicle to interact and easily share artifacts. Commercial vendors would able to differentiate their products with advanced Ops capabilities. Tool providers would be attracted to contribute and integrate their offerings if they could consistently reach a larger user base. It is our intention to propose an extensibility model and show results from an initial prototype that bridges a well-known distribution (OpenStack-Ansible) and a well-known Ops monitoring tool (Nagios Core), and to explain how this model can be extended.

SAP's DevOps Journey: from building an app to building a cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SAP has been using a DevOps & Continuous Delivery approach for building its web and mobile apps for several years, and in the Cloud Infrastructure Service we are now building and running a global cloud at the scale needed to run not only SAP's internal business applications but also the cloud applications used by over 100 million people at SAP's 300,000 customers. In this talk we tell the story of how SAP originally adopted DevOps practices with a simple pilot. That pilot included a bare-bones DevOps platform which evolved through several stages to become a next-generation open-source-based cloud and deployment automation system using OpenStack and Kubernetes. At each stage of the journey we examine the technical and organisational challenges we faced and share how we overcame them. The most important lesson of all? Ultimately, it's about the people.

Upgrading OpenStack Millennium Edition to OpenStack XP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every successful software company thrives when there’s a good mix of talented senior engineers and entry-level engineers. However, when today's curriculum focuses around AI and mobile development, it can be hard to find talented college students interested in cloud. Let's say you do find a new hire willing to jump into the vast unknown that is OpenStack; how do you take that engineer and bring them up in a fast-paced environment without overwhelming them and driving them away?  Attendees will walk away with the do's and don'ts for hiring and developing young talent from those who've gone through the process first hand. We'll talk about our experiences that include: starting out as new hires tasked with developing IBM's public cloud, joining a more experienced team (Blue Box), and taking on critical roles within the organization. We'll also discuss our experience recruiting and mentoring new hires and interns, giving them the tools and knowledge to succeed in the OpenStack environment.

What we learned along the way: Internap's history with OpenStack and our plans for the future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In early 2014, Internap was at a crossroads: either we would continue writing, maintaining and supporting our internal cloud platform or we would find an alternative. While searching, we kept coming back to this intriguing, well-publicized and yet mysterious and growing community: OpenStack. It was so intriguing that we took the leap of faith and joined! But, being the newb on the block, we had a very long road unfolding ahead of us: how to adopt and embrace all the benefits of this new family. This is the story of our journey: from complete stranger, to enthusiastic user, to regular contributor and all the lessons we learned along the way.

Why Enterprises Want Containers Now (and why you should too)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It took enterprises a decade or more to embrace virtualization. It was a massive, quantum leap from the mindset of one server, one OS, one workload. Virtualization was a relatively easy sell: cost compression was the name of the game, and no one played the game better than VMware. But once the public cloud (AWS, etc.) and open source options (OpenStack, etc.)  came along, enterprises had to fundamentally shift the way they thought about application development and deployment, as well as infrastructure operations. It was a big shift. It took time. But once enterprises “got it,” things started to change. Why have containers caught on faster than VMs? Do enterprises want both? What lessons can we learn from early mistakes the pioneers have made in containers deployment? This session will provide a better understanding on how enterprises—in growing numbers—have crossed the barrier and are thinking “cloudy” about app dev and ops, leading them to ask, “Do we even need VMs?”

AIOrchestra. AsyncIO-based open source TOSCA orchestration framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OASIS TOSCA gains more and more involvement into cloud orchestration no matter what it is. OpenStack is not an exception: Murano accepts TOSCA through its plugins Tacker uses to describe NFV deployment topology Heat-translator (TOSCA to HOT) toscaparses library lived under OpenStack "Big Tent" So, as it can be seen, TOSCA is more than just yet another way to describe deployments, it is future for orchestration itself. But TOSCA is just a DSL to describe topology. AIOrchestra is an engine to process TOSCA DSL to real deployment process. By use of modern python 3.5 technologies like coroutines with async/await syntax AIOrchestra allows DevOps/Developers to write TOSCA templates to describe how they want to see their apps in clouds and the way how it would get into cloud. AIOrchestra is not a just a product driven by specific organisation, it is the way to reconsider the way we develop and deploy. The idea that stands behind it - open platform, open capabilities, open TOSCA.

An Interoperable Image Service Powered By OpenStack Glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Glance supports uploading images for many formats (qcow2, docker, etc.) and purposes (VMs, volumes, containers, etc.). Being able to use an image, however, requires some specific knowledge, for example, what disk and container formats are supported in that cloud, the largest system disk available, etc.  Since Liberty, the Glance team has been working on a more refined API that will help users discover both the platform they can use to upload image data to and the particular formats, sizes, etc. supported in that cloud. This discovery mechanism helps build clients deterministically to build a seamless call for the image import process. This single workflow which lets operators define and users choose a way they want to upload image data makes uploads more performant and flexible.  And did we mentions that it's fully interoperable?  We want to tell you all about it.

AT&T’s Agile Journey: OpenStack Platform Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In early 2014, AT&T had a multiple teams working on OpenStack development. As a result there were inconsistent and unaligned delivery processes. Since then AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) has iteratively implemented advanced Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices enabling Agile development teams to actively develop features, integrate new technologies, fail fast, and frequently deliver releases. Our journey has included rapid adoption of community build and coding standards. Behind the scenes implementation of Continuous Delivery using Fuel to provide AIC Verification Testing (AVT).

**Abstract:**

Testing an OpenStack deployment by running 100s of detailed manual test scripts is a very time consuming effort.  Luckily, the Tempest test framework has a plugin interface and scenario test framework that can be leveraged for automating detailed test scenarios. In addition to standard scenario test, that drive the OpenStack REST APIs, it is also possible to create scenario tests utilizing the WebDriver API for simulating browser interaction with Horizon, for full end-to-end UI test scenarios. Furthermore, a Tempest plugin can be installed into a Rally deployment, so you can leverage the power of Rally for persisting your test runs , as well as create reports and compare test runs etc. This presentation will outline and demonstrate the entire process for automating a single detailed test scenario.

Beyond Refstack:  The Interop Challenge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is really big on interoperability.  It has a board chartered committee to drive ever more encompassing interop tests and a project to help run those (and soon other) interop test sets.  But, these efforts are painfully limited due to the youthfulness of OpenStack, the software collection.  So, what can we do to aid interop without stepping on toes?  A consortium of companies have agreed to collaborate on (drum roll, please) The Interop Challenge! The Interop Challenge is using the OpenStack community to create a collection of applications that use the most attainable OpenStack tools (heat and murano) to demonstrate specific workloads for the cloud.  And the challenge is for these community created applications to run successfully across all and any participating vendor's products and/or services. Come join in the fun!

Creating a virtual data center with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When we decided to provide an OpenStack-based public cloud in multiple locations worldwide while maintaining some of our current infrastructure, we knew we would have a big problem to solve: how to alleviate data center hardware complexity. Buying a set of expensive core routers and $100K switches for each developer was not an option. Our solution was to write a complete set of mocking software for all the different types of hardware present in our data centers. Martin Roy and Jonathan Provost will explain how this virtual approach allowed us to quickly iterate through our OpenStack implementation while maintaining a completely automated software process. We will show how the system works and how it can be extended to fit a variety of developer needs.

Drag and drop tool of Heat to help simplify creating stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Currently use heat to create stacks you have to manually write template files which have limited rules on syntax and format. Users spent much time on learning heat templates and tried to debug times to generate valid templates. This drag and drop tool is integrated into stacks panel page in Horizon. With the tool to create stack, what you need are: drag resource images, input required properties of resources and indicate relationships among resources. The tool will validate your inputs on each step and finally generate valid templates that you could use to create stacks. It greatly simplify creating heat stacks.

Helping OpenStack adoption with an OCCI API Playground (and other OCCIware goodness)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

API adoption is a challenge for OpenStack's rich and complex APIs - a challenge that the OpenStack API Working Group has taken on in strides. In this talk, we will look at a way of helping API adoption, but we'll go beyond API documentation and technical playgrounds such as Swagger. We want to make the case for an interactive online tooling that takes advantage of REST discoverability. In a word, we introduce a REPL shell for REST APIs. We'll showcase a generic playground developed (as part of the OCCIware open source platform) for the OGF's Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), a generic API supported by OpenStack. We'll demonstrate how a beginner OpenStack OCCI API user can execute live examples in seconds, browse through REST resources (such as VMs), and easily generate and derive all kind of queries or changes. We'll finally show how this playground, as well as OCCI standard and OCCIware platform, is a solution to manage other layers and domains in the overall cloud stack.

HOT for Heat: Validating your Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Need a way to test your actual stack deployment? Test networking, user permissions, storage access, security and more using HOT. HOT - Heat Orchestration Test is a framework that automates the validation of a deployment. HOT supports template yaml syntax checking, stack build success verification and a highly-flexible fabric-based testing to test the resulting servers. HOT has the ability to run tests from inside your resources and also from outside your environment. Fabric based tests use envassert and any other methods possible in a python script, this ssh’s onto your resource and runs tests. You can check firewall rules, running processes, ensure ports are open, files exist, etc. Script tests are used for testing from outside the environment. Examples include running selenium tests from your CI server, verifying service availability from outside the environment, or calling third party services to run tests such as vulnerability assessment or performance testing.

How Symantec enhanced OpenStack LBaaS to support legacy LB features via open source Neutron plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SYMC's Cloud P'form Engg team built their pvt OpenStack cloud to host a suite of security/storage-aaS apps. Initially, migrated legacy apps from non-cloud environment to this OpenStack cloud.Legacy apps relied on many LB features implemented on physical LBs.In OpenStack clouds, functionality available thru LBaaS APIs was very limited.Example: HTTP Redirect, backup 404 page, rate limiting to front end VIP, multi SSL Cert, custom health checks, etc could not be exercised via LBaaS APIs.So, to enhance LBaaS offering:- discuss how SYMC leveraged an open source Neutron plugin, implemented a generic mechanism that would allow a user to invoke any arbitrary functionality of LBs outside LBaaS APIs.- explain details of that generic mechanism and how can be used even outside of LBaaS to extend other projects.- explain how OpenContrail Neutron plugin was leveraged in this exercise.- emphasize on how this was done in spirit of community collaboration.

Master to Metal with OpenStack Charms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How do specific OpenStack commit levels stack up in the metal rack?  In this talk we will discuss the use of OpenStack Charms to deploy OpenStack from source to bare metal, and why that is useful.  Developers and users alike can use the same set of OpenStack Charms to deploy and manage long-running production-grade clouds from stable cloud archive packages as well as dev, test and staging clouds directly from upstream project source code. Packaging can be tricky.  Repackaging from master can be a significant hurdle for a dev or operator to overcome in order to deploy trunk/master onto metal.  The OpenStack Charms enable devs and operators to leap that hurdle without having to repackage from trunk, as a valuable tool for evaluation and development.

OpenStack Tempest and REST API Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Tempest— OpenStack’s integrated test suite— used to verify various components of OpenStack cloud. In this talk, we will explain how this test suite can be used to qualify various components of OpenStack. We will use Cinder (Block storage) as the case study for verifying with Tempest. By using Tempest, we are going to verify a Cinder Rest API. This verification infers how many tests are executed, which test cases passed, and how many of them failed. From a Performance perspective, this result will show the amount of time needed to execute individual test cases and overall test coverage. Also, we will explain the configuration changes required in various releases to execute the Tempest test. We will explain how additional customer or feature specific test cases can be incorporated in the Tempest test suite.

Paas on Openstack – an efficient foundation for CI/CD pipelines.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Continuous Integration is typically about creating numerous application instances repeatedly. These instances are transient in nature. They are brought to life only to undergo a certain set of tests or validation and to be discarded. To support the deployment of these application instances, organizations maintain dedicated environments, which leads to unnecessary operational overhead. PaaS on Openstack provides new automation opportunities and a more efficient CI process. The presentation explains a single PaaS instance deployed on Openstack securely serves all CI phases and ensures consistency across them. It demonstrates dynamic orchestration of containers on PaaS, which in turn drives the underlying Openstack to create additional compute and storage capacity within the security constraints to support transient application instances. The containers and compute resources are later removed or vacated to give room to other apps going through the pipeline.

OpenStack developers will benefit from the early testing of their patches together with other OPNFV components using OPNFV test frameworks and CI pipeline running against distributed bare metal labs We share experience from setting up the 3rd party CI, explain how the CI systems are connected and discuss benefits for developers and users from both communities We explain the difference between OPNFV’s 3rd party CI and typical company 3rd party CI. In OPNFV we do two different things: Besides Helping OPNFV projects to access OpenStack patches using the combined CI pipeline we also establish a service to OpenStack by reusing OpenStack Infra utilities to create OPNFV scenarios like HA and bare metal testing

The Gentle Breeze - Functional Testing in Neutron with Zephyr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides the Tempest testing framework to test OpenStack feature functionality.  However, it can be too high-level to test and debug Neutron as a standalone service. Zephyr is an open source framework for developers to test neutron as a standalone entity. Zephyr makes it easy for Neutron developers to test against the Neutron API.  Zephyr is also designed to allow extensible support for Neutron plugins, streamlining Neutron API compatibility testing for third-party Neutron plugin developers. This session will introduce the Zephyr project and design principles, and then we will show a Zephyr running on example test cases, and finally we will create a simple test in Zephyr and show the test results during the session.

The Shell in the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Iridium is a test shell, which will help manage the one component most testing and development organizations have been needing: a low-level automated exploratory test shell for engineers to perform micro-bench test for ad-hoc testing and reproduction of existing defects. This focus differentiates Iridium from Tempest and Rally, as those two frameworks / testbeds are aimed at testing a completed solution. This is better known as an end-to-end scenarios test, which is also known as black box testing. This approach is needed to insure that the customer experience is free of external API service fouls, but it does not address issues where code path may not be executed due to varying configurations or the fact that most commands are canned or preformatted. The ability to perform white box testing in a controlled shell will allow quality engineers to have a closer working relationship and will enable the faster production of quality software.

Using OpenStack to Test Baremetal Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many OpenStack (and other) deployment frameworks have a way to do bare metal provisioning as part of the deployment. However, due to cost and security reasons, it’s extremely difficult to use actual hardware for continuous integration (CI) testing of this functionality. A number of solutions exist, but they all have drawbacks, such as poor security, flexibility, scalability, or performance. Wouldn't it be nice to take advantage of OpenStack to solve all those problems at once? It would allow testing infrastructure to be deployed on-demand, potentially eliminating much of the need for dedicated bare metal CI hardware. This session will explain how to use OpenStack instances to test bare metal-style deployments, including deployment of OpenStack itself.

Hard facts behind “Software-Defined” - What it means, and How to enable your business
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We have all heard that “software-defined” is the future, if not the present, of the data center.But what does software-defined really mean, where did it come from, and what are its technology and business implications?Which parts of the data center can you define with software, and what are the risks? What will it cost, and how long will it take? What are your options for getting up and running quickly? These are just a few of the questions we face. In this session, SUSE and Midokura team up to present the current state of the software-defined data center, and provide a concrete framework to determine whether and when to move forward.We discuss how software-define applies to compute, storage, and networking, and how OpenStack gets you on the path to SDDC.We present use cases from real enterprise deployments, and recommendations on getting started, a path to deployment, and typical gotchas.

Interop? You Keep Using That Word, I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Increasingly, interoperability is the focus of conversation as we enter the era of multi cloud. Still up for debate though, is where exactly this compatibility should be focused: at the infrastructure or orchestration level? For example, at the infrastructure layer, the ability to perform actions between clouds using Federated Keystone to operate one cloud from another was demonstrated in Vancouver at the OpenStack Summit 2015. At the orchestration layer, we can focus on the interoperability of tools like Terraform and Heat across different clouds to achieve interoperability of your workloads. We’d also like to explore some interesting workload-based scenarios for demonstrating interoperability at both the infrastructure and orchestration levels (as guided by DefCore and tested by RefStack). Which path will lead to driving different clouds to support similar features while also providing the right feedback to the ecosystem? Join us for a spirited discussion!

Introducing OpenStack to a Traditional Infrastructure Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Introducing open source technology can be a daunting task within a traditional infrastructure team. So, how does an individual contributor within an infrastructure team begin to expose his peers to OpenStack and related technologies? Exposing peers to an unfamiliar technology and a new way to manage and deploy infrastructure and resources can be a challenge. In this talk, we will explore how to engage peers in discussing OpenStack and related technologies. First, I will discuss ways to initially expose peers to OpenStack. We’ll discuss ways in which OpenStack can simplify a traditional infrastructure team’s ability to deliver a higher quality of service and support to end users. Next, we will take a look at discovering where OpenStack can best benefit a legacy infrastructure team future direction. Finally, we will discuss ways to identify opportunities for OpenStack deployments to ensure success.

MythBusting OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We've all heard people say things like, "OpenStack is a competitor to AWS and VMware," or "OpenStack is a turnkey cloud solution," or even "OpenStack kills and replaces your virtual infrastructure solution."  While it's true that OpenStack provides a solution for many people with many different interests and goals, there are some obstacles that we need to be vigilant about pushing back on. After working with many OpenStack customers we have realized that in many cases the reality is not meeting the expectations and we want to help make a clear separation for everyone's benefit. It is important for new stackers to understand the realities, separate them from the myths, and recognize how it can really help them.  In addition of debunking myths, we will illustrate how stackers can bring a new set of realities and possibilities back to their teams, developers and organization. Based on our experience, these key takeaways will help you bring some of the misconceptions to reality.

Using OpenStack personas to build an effective cloud strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What are user personas in OpenStack? How do they relate to and differ from each other, and what do you need to know about them to provide the best possible user experience? User personas have been an effective method to describe customer needs and expectations for decades. No matter what part of a software product, documentation, or web-site you develop, you should always consider the audience you are targeting. While analyzing OpenStack user personas, we debated a number of possible options and used various techniques, such as analyzing our web-site visitors profiles, as well as feedback from our services and support organizations, in-person interviews, quantitative and qualitative testing. Our main goal was to shift from the “Just deploy OpenStack” mentality to “How do we make our customers successful with OpenStack?”

A glimpse of deploying OpenStack for the uninitiated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Creating an OpenStack environment is always an interesting journey and one created solely to be a test bed for new OpenStack features has its share of challenges. With the aim of repeated tear-down and recreation of OpenStack and an ‘Infrastructure as Code’ mindset with no prior sysadmin or OpenStack experience, using OpenStack components to deploy OpenStack was a fun goal to achieve. With multiple components and tools needed to deploy the Undercloud and the Cloud, this talk aims to share the experience of three developers creating a fast and easy deployment system and our learnings.


* **Anup Navare** *(I am a recent college graduate from Santa Clara University, CA and joined Intel last year.

Behind the curtains - What Happens When Booting a Virtual Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A behind the scenes look at booting a virtual machine.  Examine what happens when a VM is launched and booted from Cinder volumes with Neutron ports and PCI-passthrough.  A great introduction to Nova and Neutron to help users understand what is happening and how different configuration changes impact the VM performance.  People working with OpenStack in production and developing on top of OpenStack would benefit from this talk to better understand how all the pieces come together to successfully deploy a virtual machine and how to troubleshoot problems when things go wrong.

Bootstrapping a Cloud Devops team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Adding new members to any team can be difficult and time consuming but it’s a part of the daily life in any organization. To large Telco environments that deploy clouds for NFV there are new and unique methods, practices and training that need to be deeply ingrained in order to teach DevOps to every new team member. How do you create a brand new, bleeding edge training program and why spend the time doing so? Enabling developers and managers to quickly and effectivity ramp up and learn new technologies and be contributing team members is just as essential, if not more important than the everyday development activities that keep the lights on. We all know about the bus factor(how many people on your team does it take to get hit by a bus before you can’t deliver). How do we create a training program that tries to first get someone off the ground as a new hire and still have a flow for more seasoned DevOps veterans from other backgrounds and experiences?

Couch to OpenStack - Simplifying the Starter's Journey with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting started with OpenStack isn't always easy. It's ok to admin it, but there's no reason we can't fix it!  Together we walk through using the OpenStack Cookbook lab and other freely available resources to get you started on your journey to OpenStack.  We will level up ops admins, network admins, developers, and anyone from all areas to show you how to easily map your skills into OpenStack as you build a foundation of learning in a very simple to deploy home lab.  Hardware helps, but the sample lab deploys on VirtualBox on your laptop.  We will also illustrate some common use cases in a practial lab right in the live session!  Let's learn together!

Diary of a Wimpy Dev: Faking it as an Op
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For the last 6 months, an OpenStack developer has been building and managing not just the OpenStack source code but OpenStack itself. Looking up from a VM on his laptop, the OpenStack dev stumbled upon a few high-end rack servers, a few switches and router, and some power cords, and imagined a world unbounded by the limitations of a single piece of hardware. He dreamed of unlimited power and the adulation of his peers for building such a useful tool. So off he began on his quest to build a cloud for him and the masses. This talk follows the daily struggles of an OpenStack developer trying to deploy and use the very code they have created.

Feeling a bit deprecated? We are too. Let's work together to embrace the OpenStack Unified CLI!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Does anyone else recall learning the CLI of the OpenStack projects and scratching their head in bewilderment as to the variance in naming, structure, and arguments for the various projects? And then the output you received from executing the command was different depending on which project you were running against?Enter the OpenStack Unified CLI to level set these commands. The Unified CLI not only attempts to create a consistent feel between the OpenStack projects, it also is a pluggable architecture to dynamically provided commands, depending on which OpenStack components you had installed. For instance, you don't get OpenStack bare metal unless you have Ironic installed.In this session we will deep dive into the OpenStack Unified CLI. We’ll show how it works behind the scenes, and we’ll discuss its available plugins. We’ll also provide some troubleshooting guidance for those times when things don't work as expected.

From How-To to POC to Production: Learning By Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One does not simply learn how to build production-grade OpenStack! The major distributions (and scripted installs like Devstack) have taken the guesswork out of getting OpenStack up and running. Gone are the days of spending days building your first OpenStack cloud using the how-to on openstack.org. But without this, how does one really learn the intricacies of OpenStack? And what happens when it's time to build your first production-grade cloud? A highly available OpenStack cloud consists of much more than just the big tent projects... numerous other open source applications are involved in making it work. And there's a gap in documentation between proof of concept and production creating a bigger leap than should exist. In this session we'll demonstrate what it takes to actually go from How-To to POC to production-grade OpenStack, filling in the gaps that exist and learning along the way.

From Venti Lattes to Valet Parking: Wacky Analogies to Explain OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Trying to explain what you do (and why it matters) to friends at the bar, other parents at the PTA, or your relative? Does your new hire or intern truly get it? What about the CFO who has to sign a big check for services ... but really needs to wrap her head around what her company is buying first? We're here to help developers, salespeople and everyone who answers questions about OpenStack to better articulate what we offer, how it works, and how users can benefit. For example:  What's the difference between object storage and block storage? How does networking work in the cloud? Why do for-profit companies benefit from an open source project (and bother contributing back to it)? Both technical and non-technical people will benefit from this fun, irreverant and enlightening chat. We compare OpenStack and its services to everything from cake to valet parking in an effort to help everyone understand how OpenStack functions.

Introduction to OpenStack's Components Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the leading Open Source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform formed by more than 50 interrelated components, and understanding the inside of a component can be a daunting experience for new contributors.In this talk we'll have a look at the internal architecture of the main OpenStack components, showing their similarities and disparities, and the common Oslo libraries used, providing solid group for new contributors that start looking at the code. As part of the OpenStack ecosystem, these components are not isolated entities, so we'll briefly go over the communications between components as well. By following from end to end a complex flow requiring communication between components, and explaining the weakest points where things could go wrong, the importance of having this full picture will be shown. In this talk we'll not go over the conceptual architecture of OpenStack itself, or cover all the different components.

Keep Calm, And Use OpenStack Consistently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Why the heck do I need to know Cinder gives me volumes, or that Nova has something to do with compute? What is a Cloud Kitty? Fact, OpenStack public clouds today expose different versions to users. Just wait until you see the face on the application developer when she learns her application only works on some OpenStack clouds. In addition deployers of OpenStack clouds have to be aware of a big tent. What does that even mean? Which of the 50+ OpenStack projects do I need in order to be considered an OpenStack cloud? Join Mike Perez who is employed by the OpenStack Foundation, focusing on cross-project initiatives in the OpenStack project as he navigates through the open source tools available today for consumers, deployers and developers building and interacting with OpenStack public/private/hybrid clouds.

No Valid Host was Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sometimes we get “No valid host was found” error message in the scheduler logs when trying to create a volume in Cinder or create a share in Manila.  What does it mean?  In this session, we will explain how the scheduler chooses a host for volume and share placement in Cinder and Manila and how to debug the “No valid host was found” error message so that your volume/share creation becomes successful.  We will also be discussing about various filters and weighers options in Cinder and Manila.

Oh! Oh! Oh! DEPLOY! DEPLOY! (aka Triple-O Deployment Model)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every distribution seems to have their own OpenStack installer. Weighing the pros and cons of the different installers is a presentation of its own. In this session, we’re focusing on the TripleO installer.The TripleO deployment model utilizes OpenStack. This is sometimes confusing, but it can be disastrous if you accidentally do something in the wrong cloud. In this presentation, we will cover the basics of the TripleO deployment model and start to unravel the mysteries of the process where one cloud becomes two. We'll start by covering basic TripleO terminology and end with a review of the templates that are utilized by OpenStack to deploy OpenStack.

OpenStack - so what is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you are knee-deep in a particular technology it is easy to forget that there is a world out there that is trying to get in, and quite often it's not an easy journey. I see this time and time again with OpenStack. It is a fast pace project that can add immense value to your business, but there's almost too much information out there to help people cut to the chase. In this talk I want to simply talk about what you need to know when looking to adopt OpenStack. I've been a customer researching OpenStack since the first release. I've been a contributor. I'm an author of several OpenStack books. I now help people get the best out of OpenStack at Rackspace.  I will cover 1) Understanding what is OpenStack 2) Help deciding whether OpenStack is a good fit for you and your business 3) Understanding what it takes to operate OpenStack I may or may not do karaoke at this one. Depends how the Disney law-suit is going from the last time I attempted it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is an open source, standards based cloud orchestration and services platform that has taken industry relevance both in Private and Public Cloud Deployments, mainly because its modular and flexible architecture. As any other open source software, OpenStack has its challenges from the design, deployment, implementation and operations perspective. Both Enterprises and Cloud/SP providers are looking for solutions that integrate OpenStack smoothly and help them to solve their pains, decrease costs and increase margins by creating new Cloud Services faster. Cisco is aware of the challenges and customers needs around OpenStack and we have been very engaged since the creation of OpenStack Foundation. This is a beginner full-day techtorial and it is directed to those who are new in Openstack but wants to understand from what is cloud to the openstack architecture. We will also provide an overview of latest OpenStack Release and how Openstack Community works.

Root Cause Analysis: Principles and Practice in OpenStack & beyond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A broad look at the field of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in the Cloud, in OpenStack, and beyond. The world of Cloud, and computing in general, is one of increasingly complex systems. With sophisticated algorithms and swift automation, we are able to develop systems (such as the Internet) that form the foundation of modern life. However, when these systems fail or suffer at times, their complexity becomes a barrier to getting to the root of the problem, understanding it and fixing it. Thus, there is a compelling need for partial and even full automation of Root Cause Analysis, a.k.a. RCA, in order to facilitate fault management. In this session we will examine the domain of RCA and address issues such as when should RCA be undertaken, and what are its goals. We will review various accepted methodologies for achieving efficient and effective fault management. We will then shift from this broad view and focus for the remainder of our talk on RCA in OpenStack.

The Operators’ View on the Certified OpenStack Administrator Exam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has become a sought-after skillset for IT professionals. Now, more than ever, employers are looking to certifications for validation to ensure that they are hiring the right skill sets from the marketplace. However, with the plethora of vendor-specific certifications, it is a challenge to determine which job candidates have the necessarily skills to operate OpenStack clouds. Enter the Certified OpenStack Administration (COA) program and exam: developed by a dozen companies from 10 countries who established a community working group to define skills and capabilities needed. The hands-on exam tests real ops skills, rather than delivering another paper certification. Hear from a panel of operators that have already passed the COA and get their perspective on how best to prepare for the exam. No, we won’t divulge the test questions, but attendees will receive sage advice from those who have achieved certification so that they can improve their chances of passing.

What is OpenStack ? The comprehensive answer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

"What is OpenStack ?" is easily the most common question we receive. And yet our most common answer still is "well, it's complicated". OpenStack is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Is it a common goal, a bunch of Python code, a single product, a set of disconnected projects, a job market, an interoperable standard, a community, a set of principles, a social experiment ? In this talk, Thierry Carrez, Director of Engineering at the OpenStack Foundation and chair of the OpenStack Technical Committee, draws on the past 6 years of academic research on that question to deliver the final, ultimate and complete answer.

WTF is OoO: Owls All The Way Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The world is really a flat plate resting on the back of a giant tortoise and what is that turtle standing on? Why, it's turtles all the way down! TripleO is OWLS all the way down, a project aimed at installing, upgrading and operating OpenStack clouds using OpenStack’s own cloud facilities as the foundation - building on Nova, Ironic, Neutron and Heat to automate cloud management at datacenter scale. With TripleO, you start by creating an undercloud (an actual operator facing deployment cloud) that will contain the necessary OpenStack components to deploy and manage an overcloud (an actual tenant facing workload cloud). The overcloud is the deployed solution and can represent a cloud for any purpose (e.g. production, staging, test, etc). The operator can choose any of available Overcloud Roles (controller, compute, etc.) they want to deploy to the environment.

Hands-on Workshops
------------------


Advanced Heat: Getting the Most Out of Your Stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Heat is an extremely useful OpenStack service — and one that you're almost certainly not using to its full potential. In this workshop, you'll learn about advanced Heat concepts, and use Heat to the best of its abilities. Among the things you'll learn, we'll include: A refresher on cloud-init, cloud-config and its Heat resource, OS::Heat::CloudConfig — an extraordinarily useful means to configure your VMs right when you boot them OS::Heat::WaitCondition and OS::Heat::WaitConditionHandle — allowing you to streamline the deployment of dependent resources OS::Heat::ResourceGroup — enabling you to define arbitrarily complex resource bundles, and using them as you would any other simple Heat resource These advanced Heat features are highly useful, but badly under-utilized — you should know and use them! In hands-on lab sessions, you'll learn how you'll use these advanced resource types to deploy complex virtual environments quickly and easily, on an OpenStack cluster of your own.

Branding Horizon: A Guide to Customize All The Things!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the theming architecture now available in Horizon, customizing the look and feel is now easier than it has ever been.  Although the base user interface of Horizon is perfectly usable, most of the companies that deploy Horizon for enterprise purposes seek to reband and customize many aspects of the current UI.  In the past, this has been possible, but only through the burden of maintaining many patches and a spaghetti mess of CSS specificity.  This tends to be less than ideal, as it makes it difficult for branding customizations to survive between releases and ever evolving code.

Building a Heat Template from the Ground Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will teach you to build a OpenStack Heat template from the ground up. The traditional approach to learning Heat usually involves setting up WordPress or another application through a Heat template. This lab is different. Namely, there will be no application at the end of it, just a VM with "Hello, world" in its message of the day. This gives us the luxury of focussing on what comes before the user-data script that deploys WordPress. The aim of this lab is a more basic understanding of two things: First, the building blocks and infrastructure an OpenStack based setup of one or more servers consists of: virtual machines, virtual networks and floating IP addresses, to name but a few. Second, it will teach participants how to describe all of these building blocks reproducibly in terms of a Heat template. This Heat template will be assembled step by step, with debugging practice for various common errors along the way.

Get started with the OpenStack REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot of people out there are using OpenStack in some way, not as many have been interacting with OpenStack from their own application - but a lot of these people would gain a lot of the possibility to do so. The goal with this session is to do an introduction to the OpenStack REST APIs and end up with a created server in an OpenStack public cloud - completely via the REST API. Python is the most used programming language around OpenStack, but to make this more common for the regular web developer, this session will use PHP, HTML and JavaScript. This session is both a guide to get started with the API, as well as a "hands on lab" - you can follow along and create your own scripts during the session.

How to Write a Network Function and Deploy in your OpenStack Cloud in less than 30 mins!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So, you have implemented a super cool network function and want to make it available to your cloud users. You want the network function to be a part of a service chain composed of other functions, or your awesomesauce network function supports the combination of functions in the chain. Your network function simply needs data ports and management ports, you don’t care about how the network plumbing happens. Your network function supports a simple CRUD API for instantiation, configuration, health and usage monitoring. Beyond that you expect the higher level orchestration to manage the lifecycle of your network function regardless of whether this happens over-the-cloud or under-the-cloud. With the help of a policy-based framework, we will show you just how to do all of this in OpenStack. We call this the Bring Your Own Function (BYOF) paradigm. You will stand up an OpenStack cloud with the policy-based framework and the Network Function Plugin that will drive your network functions.

OVN based OpenStack Cloud Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying OpenStack cloud is not an easy task. It is especially difficult when you are new to OpenStack. There are so many configuration parameters and plugins that you can choose from when you deploy OpenStack cloud. These parameters and plugins make OpenStack cloud very flexible and full of possibilities, but for a new OpenStack developer or a cloud administrator, It creates a steep learning curve, when it comes to OpenStack Neutron, that difficulties just jump to a whole new level. In this hands-on workshop, I will introduce a simple bash script based vagrant project and show you how you can easily deploy an OpenStack cloud onto either virtual machines or physical machines. I will use the OVN plugin as an example. If you like to experience different neutron plugins such as LinuxBridge, OVS, you can simply change one flag in this project configuration file, you will have an OpenStack cloud with your chosen neutron plugin.

Pocket-OpenStack: Build a usable multinode setup (Controller, 3xCompute, Network) on your 8GB laptop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This hands-on workshop will lead you in 90 minutes to a full blown multinode setup with Controller, 3x Compute and NetNode on your >=8 GB laptop. You will install the setup in a specially prepared, containerized virtual environment using Fedora or any other recent distribution. With this setup it is also possible to test and try out things like IPA integration or special storage environments like NFS or Ceph. We will touch those capabilities as well. The way we install the whole setup allows you to use the full (not! nested) virtualization power of your CPU and almost all of the RAM for your VMs, so that real life workloads of OpenStack are possible (within the scope of your laptops CPU). So if you are a developer, tester or consultant and in constant resource pressure for doing real tests with multiple machines for many purposes as testing features, easily extending and rebuilding setups, PoCs, learning, developing and preparation of presentations, then this workshop is for you.

How To & Best Practices
-----------------------


A Better Way to Cook RabbitMQ Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying OpenStack in a large scale environment, we can regard a message queue(MQ) as a bottleneck. To reduce the message consumption per MQ cluster, OpenStack operators typically allocate a component with high communication costs on another MQ cluster separately.However, for those operators, managing multiple MQ clusters could be a nightmare. Therefore, in order to relieve the operators’ work load, we will present our evaluation result on a large OpenStack deployment with a single large RabbitMQ cluster, which is easier to manage. We tackled with the following two evaluations. First, we investigated details of messaging mechanism in OpenStack to reveal the bottleneck. Second, we conducted examination of RabbitMQ’s ha-mode, queue mirroring, and load balance to find the best practices.Then, we applied the above results to our staging environment and evaluated our RabbitMQ cluster in a large OpenStack deployment.

A New Approach to Scheduling Database Management Tasks in Trove with Mistral
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the features that has long been on the Trove roadmap was support for scheduled backups. One of the challenges with implementing this is the need for a scheduler and something to control scheduled execution. Re-inventing these components in Trove was something that no one in the community wanted to do. This session will discuss how a Trove-Mistral integration can meet these requirements as well as needs far beyond scheduling backups, features such as auto-scaling clusters or master database auto-failover. In this talk we will share how users can use Mistral to provide Trove-centric views to schedules and events. This approach provides example workflows for such functions as periodic database maintenance or reconfiguring replication sets when a site fails (i.e., failover).

A road to active-active mode of MySQL Galera in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Official OpenStack High availability guide configures MySQL Galera into active-backup mode, and so did all OpenStack Distribution we known. But in fact, MySQL Galera is a Multi-matser Cluster which is designed to work in active-active mode. So why OpenStack uses active-backup mode? Can we change it to active-active mode? This topic will give you a deep analysis on the performance and influence of both mode in stress tests. We will dig into each SQL and show you which part of the SQL is blocking us to use active-active mode.  Finally, we will share our solutions of how to optimize these SQLs.

Addressing Open Issues in Container Orchestration using OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Frameworks such as mesos, kubernetes and docker swarm make it possible to run containerized applications at scale across a fleet of container host. However, there are several open issues that are yet to be addressed around operationalizing these frameworks in productions. Issues such as managing the lifecycle of the underlying infrastructure (onboarding, decommissioning, maintenance, autoscaling etc), health check and monitoring, identity management, certificate / key management, security & access control, integration with existing systems (IPAM etc) and more.In this session we will list out the open challenges around operationalizing the container frameworks and propose ways in which OpenStack can be used as the platform to address these gaps, making it easy for enterprises to take these container frameworks to production.

Anatomy Of OpenStack Neutron through the eagle eyes of troubleshooters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The anatomy of an OpenStack project is different when looked at from the perspective of different roles, such as developers, system administrators, and support engineers (troubleshooters), etc. While a developer prefers to concentrate on certain areas of the code, an architect perceives the project as different pieces that need to be reconciled. System administrators and support engineers have to see both worlds when it comes to troubleshooting.In this session, you’ll learn the anatomy of OpenStack Neutron troubleshooting from the point of view of a system administrator and a support associate. We’ll discuss how a Neutron looks when we hit an issue, and how we troubleshoot to isolate the problem to a specific component. We’ll explain these challenges using examples from real troubleshooting production issues.

Automate Physical Switch port configuration for hypervisors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session is on automatic configuration of VLAN for the hypervisor connected switch ports on the TOR switch. Currently Cloud/Network administrator needs to configure VLANs manually for each physical switch port that belongs to hypervisor, as number of hypervisors increases, there is a need to automate the VLAN configuration programmatically so that manual intervention can be avoided. Usually hypervisor connected ports are trunk ports. We can also specify trunk port configuration using the baremetal network provisioning CLI.

Automating ITIL Configuration Management for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the traditional, non-virtual datacenter, enterprises have evolved ITIL systems such as CMDB and DNS to manage their infrastructure.  However, with OpenStack, there is no automatic method to integrate the VM creation with these features.  This presentation will provide a detailed, in depth engineering analysis of the design we have developed to automatically update DNS and CMDB when a VM is created.  Conversely, we automatically remove the CMDB record and DNS record when the VM is destroyed.  These methods are automatic and do not impact the creation or deletion of the VM; nor do they change the API calls to create/destroy VMs in OpenStack.  Further, ths is the best part, our software does not modify the OpenStack code so upgrading is very easy.

Building a Fortress: The easiest way to get full Role-based Access Control in Openstack Keystone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Keystone doesn’t support full Role-based access control (RBAC) by itself, but there is a very easy way to fix that by using a third-party application—Apache Fortress. Apache Fortress is an access management system based on the ANSI RBAC (INCITS 359) standard. It stores rules in OpenLDAP or Active Directory and has a nice web interface for viewing and modifying permission. Apache Fortress has everything you need for RBAC: ANSI RBAC implementation. Everything is already created, described, and documented. Apache Fortress stores entities (users, roles, permissions) in OpenLDAP or Active Directory, making it perfect for enterprises who already use LDAP or Active Directory for identity management. Because of Fortress' use of standardized LDAP backends, it is easily integrated with many other enterprise applications. Apache Fortress has RESTful APIs and a web interface. Apache Fortress integration with Keystone requires only a few lines of code changes to oslo.policy.

CI/CD testing of OpenStack releases before moving to Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack releases cycles are very fast and staying up to date with the latest release is a very daunting task. Many companies struggle keeping their OpenStack deployments up to date due to lack of time, development environment to test, the tools or methodologies to validate your environment against the newer version. There are a number of well know projects that automate the deployments but it is difficult to set up and track the results. In this talk, you will learn how Rackspace has partnered with Red Hat leveraging their Distributed Continuous Integration (DCI) product to provide CI/CD testing of new versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform to our customers. This allows us to replicate customer environments and testing things like upgrade through automation. It will also share those results with Red Hat to help create and track issues.

Cisco: Testing strategies for openstack based production cloud platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As part of the Quality Engineering team at Cisco, we have to ensure the quality and stability of the various environments and to find issues before our customers do. In this presentation we will go over the test strategies we use to accomplish this goal.  Our tests include: sanity test ongoing regression test incremental feature test user experience test perf/scale test Much attention is given to perf/scale testing, but housekeeping of production environments has not been previously discussed.Some tests run everyday to mark a baseline, while some tests are run when changes/upgrades are made. Some tests run for comparison, before and after the change window or peak and off peak hours. Also, we test the platform both, as an end user and as an admin. This ensures we hit the same pain points that an end user would hit and any ops issues an admin would see.We will also discuss the vision of automating this, which will be presented to the community separately.

Cloud Benchmarking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How will my OpenStack cloud perform against my other/existing infrastructure? How will it perform against the big three public clouds? And again other OpenStack options? When making the decision to get an OpenStack cloud it is important to anticipate performance, cost and value of that cloud with respect to the alternatives in the market. In this session, we will be defining a set of usable metrics to use to produce that comparision or scorecard and we will perform a few live tests with some workloads on the different types of clouds mentioned above, including obviously a set of OpenStack clouds built in different ways. If you want to know what to expect from OpenStack and how to relate it to other technologies, you should attend this session. If you want to know how a specific workload will perform in your OpenStack cloud, you should also attend this session

Connecting Cloud Platforms: Federating Access and Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack can evolve to attract more cloud application development by simplifying base services required by most applications. User, roles, access management are among the services which are common requirements for all applications. However, these base requirements for Identity Access Management are complicated by the fact that enterprises need identity federation and common access management. Configuring Keystone for Identity Federation is a well known concept, but it is only half the picture. Configuring Keystone to also use a common access management solution brings OpenStack closer to the proposition that application developers simply drop-in their core business value.  Overview the benefits of connecting a centralized security policy and control point to keystone. We will detail our vendor neutral implementation along with how to tips and lessons.

Continuous Documentation for OpenStack Resources with RedHat and Atlassian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How can I make software-architecture documentation available to all stakeholders in a project and which best practices make this easier? How does autmoated documentation work in the Age of DevOps? That is the question that we are trying to discuss with the community at large and answer on a practical level – using arc42 (http://www.arc42.org) as a framework and the toolsets provided by our partners Atlassian and Redhat - with an open source project for Continuous Documentation (or ConDoc) for short, which we at NetworkedAssets started last October. By the time you’ll see this presentation we will be able to present our DoS (Documentation from System Configuration) module, which focuses on deployments on RedHat OpenStack and RedHat OpenShift Enterprise (= Docker/Kubernetes, running on top of RedHat OpenStack) and the community home that we created for this project (outside of Github and our own website).

Continuously Battle Tested OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You run into this problem with your own applications everyday. You’ve got a great CI/CD process, with robust gate tests, but you still see issues appear once code gets to production. In your own applications you are lucky, you can deploy a hotfix to remedy the issue in minutes. That doesn’t translate to your OpenStack environment does it? You aren’t set up to continuously deploy OpenStack, and you can’t afford an army of OpenStack experts to track and merge any bugs that might occur when OpenStack is put in real world, production situations. Well the Ops Team at the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) is here to help. We’ve developed a multi-node reference implementation and are constantly testing it with current upstream code. That means we discover OpenStack’s production and scale bugs so that you don’t have to. We publish all the tests we perform and file and follow all the bugs we find. This means a more reliable OpenStack release for you.

Credential and switch management CLI’s for bringing physical switches in the cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation talks about managing the switch credentials of the physical switches as part of Baremetal Network provisioning. Currently there is no way to represent the physical switches in Neutron space. After Ironic Neutron integration, for Baremetal enrollment there is a need to keep the switch credential information to plumb the networks in the Neutron upon receiving the Ironic notifications.We have written a generic client framework that can support credential management for any vendor switch and their management protocol .All the credentials information are encrypted in the DB using Barbican Client library. Administrator can create the credentials using CLI and associate the physical switch for network provisioning. Administrator can see the physical switches in the Neutron. Later Baremetal servers can be provisioned using the Ironic.

Datacenter Automation Through Continuity: A Cloud in a Box.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Datacenter infrastructures are not homogenous systems, which create unique challenges for automation of Openstack as an End-to-End (E2E) installation process on bare metal servers.  New hardware, disaster recovery, and failed upgrade processes require a quick and seamless process to deploy new or augment existing environments and code levels. Installation of Openstack on new bare metal servers is a time consuming process, which involves: hardware configuration, installation of the OSP utility hypervisor, and manual data collection and configuration prior to beginning the ironic introspection process.  Through the combined use of IPAM, OSP, and CloudForms; greater efficiencies can be gained by automating hardware, network, and flavor provisioning.  Session attendees will learn strategies to further automate the deployment of OpenStack across new and existing bare metal servers to create an extensible solution for new deployments, failed upgrades, and disaster recovery scenarios.

Datacenter Deployments of OpenStack from ToR Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With current networking technologies, many top of rack switches are not being used for their full potential. Most are installed, plugged in to their uplinks and various servers and storage, and forgotten about. What if you could deploy OpenStack to an entire rack of servers that the switch is connected to? What if you could deploy the rack next to it from a single switch? What if you were able to deploy an entire Datacenter from a top of Rack Switch for a scalable OpenStack deployment? With Ubuntu, Juju, and MAAS, this is possible to do from a top of rack switch. This presentation will go over the configuration of installing Ubuntu, MAAS, and Juju on a top of rack switch, and then, using that switch, deploying OpenStack on to a rack of servers, and even having it provision another top of rack switch to show that this process can be managed for future buildout across an entire data center.

Datacenter Genesis: A Datamodel for Mastering Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

“Your new datacenter: the final deployment.These are the steps of your favorite automation tool.It’s mission: to install bare machines, to deploy new Ceph clusters and a new OpenStack installation, to boldly establish new networks and tenants where no man has provisioned a VNF before.” In a not too distant future no datacenter operator will ponder on questions such as: “How was everything designed?” or “What is the origin of this deployment?” This is because of the universally adopted use of a standard for describing datacenter deployments. Today, however, a common datamodel is missing that is understood by different automation tools. This talk will thus: * motivate the need for a tool-agnostic datamodel that covers the various aspects of datacenter deployments * highlight the many benefits when adopting such a model * and last but not least: present an approach that builds on top of established projects.

Day 2 Operations: How To Constantly Improve The Upgrade Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How do you upgrade OpenStack regions of thousands of hypervisors without your users noticing? Better yet, how do you do it at regular intervals that follow community releases?Even though everybody's doing OpenStack upgrades these days, it’s still not trivial, or even easy to do. In an ideal world, you'd be able to upgrade the packages with changes to the config files or start new Docker images, apply a new database schema, and making sure everything works. Easy, right?Unfortunately, the real­life scenario is way more complex. This session will detail about how we constantly improve our Openstack upgrade process at Symantec.

Deep performance tuning with Intel Resource Director Technology to make sure the QOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In a NFV environment, we need to guarantee VNF nodes quick response to provide high quality service. Currently, no good solutions yet. Intel® Resource Director Technology (RDT) provides the hardware framework for monitoring and control of shared data center resources. It includes Cache Allocation/Monitoring Technology (CAT/CMT),  Memory Bandwidth Allocation/Monitoring (MBA/MBM) etc. With these help, we will have good control for our cache, memory bandwidth resource, we can reserve resource for much more import workload such as for an NVF node, import data base server etc. As also RDT provides resource monitors we could use it to monitor resource usage on all OpenStack cluster which will provide a new metric for the cluster administrator to measure cluster. In this session, we will share an experience how we use RDT on OpenStack to control cache/memory bandwidth in our routine testing environment, which help use to immensely improve the work efficiency.

Deploy cloud service with Heat and Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this topic, we will show you how to leverage Ansible and Heat to bootstrap clustered applications in Openstack cloud platform. The OpenStack cloud platform is built on a variety of separate interlocking services - including separate services for storage, networking, identity, and more. We use Heat to orchestrate the resources of clustered applications. And configuring application is an complex task. We’ve got frontend and backend services, databases, monitoring, networks, and storage for an application. Each has their own role to play with their own configuration and deployment. We use Ansible tool to ensure all these tasks happen in the proper order. After all, we have the performance report for the newly configured application cluster according to presumed workload for user informantion.

Deploying Watson IoT  on OpenStack: An Enterprise Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will describe how Watson IoT with Blue Box OpenStack and Bluemix makes the Internet of Things a reality for enterprises, drawing upon examples from an enterprise deployment. When the Watson IoT team was asked to deploy to China it needed to choose a new cloud infrastructure to host the offering and implement a new deployment process to perform the deployment. We will explain why we chose Blue Box OpenStack as the cloud environment and Ansible as the configuration management technology. We will describe how the two technologies complement each other, resulting in a dramatic reduction in deployment time. We will also describe how we used Security Groups and Security Group Rules to control access to the instances in the environment and how we used the Load Balancer as a Service component to distribute both HTTP and MQTT traffic across within the offering. Finally, we summarise the advantages of using OpenStack to host the Watson IoT solution over other cloud environments.

Downstream Gate - How to set up and run pre-merge, gating CI using OpenStack CI tooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, we'll show how to set up the OpenStack CI tooling to run tests "downstream", i.e., after code has merged upstream. Everyone is talking about CI/CD pipelines these days. But "CI/CD" means a lot of different things to different people. We'll demonstrate techniques that bring the powerful OpenStack continuous integration (CI) tooling to benefit Cloud Operators. Learn how these tools allow you to run CI to test your specific deployment with the exact code you plan to deploy to production....before the proposed changes to deployment tooling or local patches are even merged into your local code repository.  Once you are able to run CI in this manner, continuous deployment (CD) can be achieved with a much higher confidence level.

Enable GPU virtualization in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nowadays, GPUs have become much more powerful while being energy efficient. With the rise in popularity of 3D applications, growth in Big Data analytics, High Performance Computing, and streaming video, GPUs are being pressed into service to gain performance. Traditionally in virtualization usages,  a physical GPU is allocated to a VM using PCI device pass-through, an approach that limits resource sharing. However, graphics virtualization support today enables GPU sharing on par with CPU sharing with tenant isolation, enabling cloud workloads to benefit from GPU processing while allowing cloud providers better returns on their infrastructure investments and thus reducing total cost of ownership. This presentation will introduce how to accelerate GPU intensive workloads in OpenStack with Intel GPU virtualization technology. We shall demo its use in OpenStack.

Estimating Resiliency: Is your cloud carrier-grade?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Your cloud runs mission critical applications. You’ve designed your applications to be resilient – but they depend on your cloud for resiliency. Is your cloud resilient? Will it fail when you need it the most? This is one of the primary challenges facing organizations seeking to deploy Openstack based private clouds today. In this presentation we will present a formal method for analyzing infrastructure software running a cloud platform. We cover various areas from high availability, failover, upgrades, configuration failures & auditing, upgrades, etc. The focus will be on analyzing software faults, identifying the impacts of those faults, verifying the findings and using specific prescriptive methods to mitigate and/or fix problems identified.

Extending OpenStack Swift usage to all users in the enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It has been said OpenStack Swift is a great storage platform – for engineers. Swift is a great storage product, But the truth is, in the enterprise, how do users interact with the data? How do you manage ACLs? How do you share data? The answer is the same - become an engineer. You need a modular suite of applications that you can grow and sculpt to fit an organization, and then re-sculpt as the needs evolve. This session will show how to make users productive and how admins can simplify management and compliance of swift data. Traditional storage requests have become self service, in an intuitive interface, via any OS, device or App. OpenStack Swift is required to offer a similar capability ie. enable users to pick what works best for them, provide the same storage view from anywhere, let users securely share data inside and outside a company if that makes the workforce more productive.

Failed OpenStack Update?! Now What?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With each OpenStack version release, new components, services, and feature sets are included to improve overall functionality. However, with the advantage of those new features comes the very real possibility of having an OpenStack failed update. Prior to attempting an update,  you are likely to ask yourself: What do I need to back up prior to the update? How do I backup my databases? How do I restore my databases? If I need to rollback all of the services, which do I start first? To answer these questions you need a comprehensive strategy to backup and restore from a failure.  This session dives into best practices on how to properly backup and restore an OpenStack environment from a failed update and will provide attendees the answers to the critical questions: What do I need to back up for the overcloud nodes and undercloud node? What is the restore process for the overcloud nodes and undercloud node?

From Our Code To Your Production Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For an OpenStack developer, it's sometimes challenging to understand how a feature will be integrated in production. And sometimes cloud users might wonder how a feature has been developed, integrated, and automated in a production cloud deployment. In this talk, we'll laugh about the famous "it worked on devstack". We'll also show you step-by-step how we develop a feature in OpenStack and then integrate it in TripleO, which is a project aimed at installing, upgrading, and operating OpenStack clouds. Come and see how your production cloud is developed and deployed under the hood.

Full OpenStack Lifecycle Management with Fuel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing an OpenStack cloud has always been complex. Even simple configuration changes on a set of nodes do not come cheap when you have to keep HA OpenStack installation up. Some teams do it with CM tools, some add home-brewed orchestration on top. This often turns into a unique suite of tightly integrated tools that becomes hard to maintain for DevOps teams. That’s what we let our users avoid with project Fuel - we provide end-to-end pipeline from the user-friendly deployment instructions to low-level state enforcement executed by a smart data driven orchestrator. New Fuel Mitaka capabilities allow for better, faster and smoother execution of complex operator-defined workflows, along with integration with external services and data sources (CMDB, LDAP, IPAM, etc.). We will show how to use these features both for day-to-day operations (change service config, install extra packages, add an OpenStack service) as well as for trickier ones (cloud upgrade, control plane recomposition).


* **Vladimir Kuklin** *(Vladimir has been working on Project Fuel since its inception in mid-2012,  responsible for the end-to-end deployment cycle, from basic provisioning of OpenStack cluster nodes, DB, AMQP and HA configuration to final configuration of all options selected by the end user as well as working on orchestration and business logic framework.)*

Great Cloud Migrations: Do we need them? What options do we have?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack successfully co-exists with other cloud technologies such as AWS, VMware and Azure. Users decide to move from one cloud technology to another, from one OpenStack provider to another or even to bring a set of different cloud technologies into their DC simply because they can do it. All clouds are built to be used - in other words, to run workloads.  One of the challenges users might face is a workload migration: between two OpenStack clouds, from AWS to OpenStack or from even OpenStack to Azure (why not?). We would like to have a discussion about cloud migrations. Are they that necessary for OpenStack cloud users? If so, in which use cases? What are the different migration strategies that have proven to be effective in the field and used by real Deployment Engineers in real production clouds? What challenges do migration mechanisms present to the whole cloud industry, and how can we overcome them?

Health-Monitoring of Large-scale Multi-site OpenStack Clusters based on Tempest and Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With rapid development and maturation of Openstack community, more corporations are running their core businesses on OpenStack. Operation engineers usually need to manage lots of clusters, some of which have a large scale and are heteroideous. Openstack has a lot of components, which leads to complex deployment and configurations. And the basic service monitoring cannot be able to reflect the status of a cluster comprehensively. In this situation, Qihoo360 uses Tempest to do integration testing for each cluster. We use docker and kubernetes to construct several isolated environments to host tempest. The solution is used in our dozens of clusters, which is proven to be effective.

Hello World for Murano - end to end process in a Docker container and more
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We've all faced challenges in porting applications to run on OpenStack. Murano helps by enabling cloud admins to publish a well-tested set of on-demand and self-service applications. End users can simply use the applications. But, have you ever wanted to set up Murano to explore its features, but been frustrated with putting all the required packages and their dependencies together and configure them correctly? Have you ever tried to build your own application catalog or create your own images, only to find out you are facing a steep learning curve. In the presentation, we will demonstrate a simple end-to-end process for getting Murano running on your dev environment or your laptop by running Murano in Docker containers. We will also demonstrate the details in case you want to dive deep into Murano including configuring murano API server and engine, building your own application images and catalog, how to upload the application catalog and deploy them using cli or UI.

Help, I've fallen and I can't get up!: Developing the ultimate help system for OpenStack operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack operators have to make important decisions quickly. They have a vast range of resources on how to design, deploy, and manage OpenStack at their disposal. So what do they do when the production server goes down despite their best efforts, and their jobs are on the line? That's what we wanted to find out.  The OpenStack UX and Documentation teams are developing research that aims to give an insight into real-word problem solving, so that we can develop useful, streamlined solutions for operators. The ability to identify and consume relevant information is largely dependent on OpenStack adoption and consumption.  This talk discusses the problems we are aiming to solve, the research methodologies, and the results of our efforts. It also aims to draw some castles in the sky of what the ultimate help solution might look like.

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack clouds scale larger and larger, a knowledge (and expectation) gap is opening between people tasked with architecting and implementing the cloud, and those whose job is to operate it day to day. In such situations, innocent actions may produce unintended consequences. Ops engineers and teams may experience sleepless nights (and stressful days) as a result — forced to do forensics on unfamiliar cloud architecture and configurations, while under heavy pressure from the business to keep end users happy, and comply with SLAs. This session aims to close the knowledge gap and head off stress by sharing best practices and lessons learned in the trenches of OpenStack production ops. We'll discuss some of the technical flora and fauna you may encounter, propose methods for informing yourself about OpenStack clouds you didn't engineer, and discuss oft-overlooked configuration and service tunings that can improve stability, and help you get a good night's sleep.

How to calculate the transition between two states of your OpenStack cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The shortest path between two points is not always a straight line, and the transition between two states of your OpenStack cluster can be more complicated than just a set of sequential changes. That's when you need to move from configuration management to orchestration. We faced this same question when solving the Lifecycle Management problem in Fuel: how do we calculate the optimal way to make these transitions? Fuel Mitaka uses the context of current and expected states of a cluster and calculates the transition graph based on introduced changes. We use YAQL (Yet Another Query Language), developed by the Murano community, to make the process of calculation fully data driven. It means that each granular part of the transition graph watches its own context changes and makes a separate decision about whether to be skipped or to be executed.

How to Deploy to an OpenStack Cloud and Create a Highly Effective Team Along the Way 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The real reason organizations want OpenStack is to run applications, but having an OpenStack Cloud at their disposal is just the beginning. There is configuration management, automation, containers, and wealth of other interesting technologies to choose from. What's more, organizations have old legacy apps sitting behind their firewalls that just won't go away.  In this session, I'll dive deep into best practices and the fundamental questions organizations need to answer to successfully and reliably go from code to production on an OpenStack cloud. I'll talk about the real-world deployment of Designate on Rackspace Public Cloud to manage its legacy DNS infrastructure. I'll provide some concise examples of how to make sure that both the dev team and operators have a clear conceptual model of what environments look like, how to update them, and the best practices that ensure organizations can go from a single cloud server to managing an entire cluster along side legacy infrastructure.

How to quickly build a multi-hypervisor dev/test environment on a single node using virtual computes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack today supports a variety of hypervisors such as KVM, ESXi, Hyperv, etc., as compute nodes. Devstack is the primary choice for developers to bring up a single node dev-test environment. A single node devstack supports only one kvm. Additional physical nodes are required to setup a multi-hypervisor environment. To address this issue, we are proposing a solution using nested hypervisors on ESXi which will instantiate multiple hypervisors on a virtual machine. We have developed an automation tool, which deploys devstack on a virtual machine, and multiple virtual hypervisors on separate virtual machines. A multi hypervisor dev-test environment can be instantiated on a single node by executing a single script. In this presentation, we will cover the following:• How to create a nested hypervisor using ESXi• How to use nested hypervisors for nova compute and neutron agents• Demo on how to run the tool and bring up a multi hypervisor environment

How to troubleshoot a highly available OpenStack Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It can easily become very complex to efficiently troubleshoot a highly available OpenStack cluster. OpenStack components, such as messaging services, load-balancers, and databases, need to be configured properly and tuned for optimum performance. Post-deployment, issues which arise need to be efficiently identified and resolved. Future deployments should benefit from lessons learned during troubleshooting. Throughout this session, we will discuss some of the more common issues which administrators encounter in their high availability deployments, how we learned to troubleshoot them, what the root cause was, and how we arrived at the right solution. Some of these problems are related with scaling load balancers that sit in front of API services, scaling rabbitmq message bus, issues related to MariaDB + Galera, and pacemaker fencing.

Is it still raining? Getting weather reports from the clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Weather has been a blackbox for ages until humanity learned how to observe and measure it's certain aspects. It was not until August of 1861 that the first ever weather report was published in The Times, giving people knowledge about conditions outside and allowing to plan their adventures a bit ahead of time. Luckily enough, we do not have to wait another century to be able to take a peek into today's clouds. OpenStack gives us a vast number of resources to master and for every successful cloud deployment it is crucial to know the resources at hand. Having this knowledge helps to plan ahead and adapt to ever changing conditions, wether it is a sunny Saturday's afternoon or Monday's heavy storms.This presentation takes focus on methods for metric processing and taking preemptive actions to avoid potential downtime. It covers key metrics and data points on the example of Nova and Cinder services. We will take a look into existing solutions, both from a big tent and from outside.

It's Not Working, What Now?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Serviceability is an awkward term, and implies that something needs to be fixed -- a situation none of us wants to find ourselves in. But all software has bugs, and all hardware breaks at some point, and so we need to know what to do when the inevitable happens.Serviceability is a design goal: how can each of the projects in the OpenStack ecosystem maximize the ease with which problems are identified, isolated and resolved? What has been done to date, and what can we do to continue and extend the process(es) already in place?Join HPE Distinguished Technologist Harry Sutton in an exploration of these questions, and join the discussion around how to keep your OpenStack environment running with a minimum of disruption.

Keep it simple: End to End Visibility for troubleshooting OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

DevOps has led to the accelerated adoption of OpenStack-based private cloud regardless of the industry vertical. As developers excel at building, testing, updating, deploying, and running, and maintaining the applications, operators are proactively looking at removing roadblocks underneath. To succeed, Operators should have end to end latency visibility for Instances supporting the several application parts in all the stages s to remove bottlenecks in the host, network or storage. Such speed and agility will accelerate DevOps adoption in the environment. In this session, we'll share actual use cases, how end to end latency visibility have helped OpenStack private cloud operators drastically reduce response time without taxing hardware, WAN or reconfiguring environment settings for each phase and has lessened the burden on them.

Keep your workload up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the perfect world everyone runs cloud-native application in their data centers, even external customers in public clouds. However, the real world is not perfect and most of VMs are treated as Cowcats or Pets. But what if it comes to situation where you will really need to keep your workload up? In our talk we will explain two primary mechanisms offered by OpenStack, which are evacuation and live-migration. Both are here to help you deal with problems that your VMs, nodes or even a datacenter might hit. We will show you different use cases that OpenStack can handle in order to minimize possible downtime that your workload can struggle with. We will share best practices and explain the difference during a live demo.

Keystone and WebSSO: A unified login system for OpenStack and other web services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides the ability to use one login for all of an organization's web services, providing a way to seamlessly sign on to each system rather than using different usernames and passwords for each system. To make this possible, you can configure Openstack Keystone and Horizon for Web Single Sign-on (WebSSO) so the user can log in to the Horizon dashboard using credentials that are authenticated using a remote authentication service. This talk describes how to configure WebSSO on Windows and Linux machines.

Large Scale OpenStack Cloud Management Using Puppet and Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many people manage OpenStack clusters with Puppet-OpenStack, and some one with Ansible. Everyone knows, Puppet is good at defining the final state of services, whereas Ansible is good at task scheduling. For OpenStack cluster deployment and management, we just need to combine the advantages of both. How? We use Puppet-OpenStack to manage cluster, and ansible to schedule Puppet-OpenStack. So that we cloud rapidly deploy cluster and converges it to the final state. In Qihoo 360, we already use this way to manage a plurality of large OpenStack clusters, and it really makes our lives easier.

Let's run Openstack Bare Metal cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running bare metal cloud on Openstack is not trivial nowadays. We're not only far from full feature parity with VMs but also need to handle more use cases specific to bare metals. In this talk we would like to present our approach to the problem of deploying bare metal cloud. We mixed Ironic Discovery with RadosGW and K8s to establish status of nodes and interconnections between them. We will walk you through the whole lifecycle - getting nodes into the datacenter, HW discovery and finally handing nodes over to customers.

Let’s Make Live Migrations Great Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Live migrations are critical to the life cycle management of OpenStack clouds and workloads running on them. The general problem is getting a predictable process that minimizes failure, the overloading of hosts, and workload downtime. Several features were introduced in Mitaka and Newton, wuch as live migration force complete, and post copy. In previous releases, there were few techniques available to ensure that the migration process finishes successfully, so all of these features are important for cloud admins to understand.   In this session, we will share our benchmark results, including different scenarios aimed to determine patterns of workload activity that affect performance of live migration as well as the reasons for those effects.

Leveraging OpenStack-Ansible to deploy the Nova-LXD compute driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many ways of running containers in an OpenStack environment.  Many deployment scenarios run containers inside of instances.  However, containers can also be deployed outside of instances, and one method of doing that is by using the nova-lxd compute driver.  OpenStack-Ansible is a community-driven way to deploy an OpenStack cloud, including a mixed hypervisor cloud utilizing the new nova-lxd compute driver.  LXD allows the resource and performance benefits of application containers, without sacrificing core system services such as logging, or requiring application rewrites to utilize existing software.  In this talk, we will show users how to configure OpenStack-Ansible to deploy a mixed hypervisor environment using KVM and LXD.

Load Balance without Load Balancer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It's almost A year and half after Kakao's revealing its network model in Vancouver summit ("SDN without SDN"). For preparing very fast growth, We made /32 bit subnet and full routing based network. VM's numbers is now heading for the 10,000 (it was not more than 1,000 at the time of last year's presentation), but we can manage very large number of VM with very small group of people due to OpenStack and Our Network Model  as well. We developed several Virtual Network Function based on our network model. One is Floating IP, The other one is programmable and scalable Load Balancer.  In Production service, people needs a way to assign Public IP or VIP through Neutron's Network node for a VM. Before Neutron's DVR is released and stablized, We also have to find a way for this network functionality. During this session we'll share about the story of developing scalable NAT and Loadbalancer without using traditional Load Balancer leveraging technology like BGP, MPLS , ECMP and Neutron.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As enterprise cloud usage grows, operators struggle to maintain a low-cost, monolithic infrastructure while satisfying users’ increasingly-specialized requirements and usage demands. Most cloud operators understand the value of OpenStack (Nova) flavors in mitigating this issue, but some struggle to effectively utilize this feature because:   They lack an adequate process and automation for flavor lifecycle management They look at tenant requirements in a siloed fashion and lack a big picture focus on the larger need to offer specialized, but standardized configurations On the other extreme, they make the mistake of trying to standardize too much without permitting the degree of specialization needed for different use-cases (the 'everything must be the same!' mantra) They have sub-optimal flavor geometries that do not maximize use of available resources In this session we'll look at how to design flavors to prevent these problems.

Managing Mistral Workflows with CloudFlow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

CloudFlow is a brand new graphical toolkit for managing Mistral workflows in the most convenient way possible. The Mistral workflow service has been around for 3 years, gaining a solid community of users who apply Mistral for a large variety of use cases. Since the beginning however, it's been challenging to work with complex parallel workflows that consist of tens or even hundreds of tasks, just by using command line interface or RESTful API. Not easy to trace errors, see the entire workflow structure or make changes. Something has always been missing... But what?  Presenting CloudFlow! With CloudFlow it’s now easy to build workflows in a drag-n-drop style. CloudFlow provides the ability to view graphical representations of workflows, run & debug them, trace errors and do a bunch of cool stuff. In this session, we'll introduce the shiny new member of the OpenStack community, code-named CloudFlow, and show a demo of how managing Mistral workflows just became a walk in the park…

Method for Monitoring Business Critical Baremetal servers using Monasca.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With Openstack Ironic-Baremetal neutron network provisioning in place, it became very easy to manage baremetal servers, including legacy servers like Web/Outlook/DNS/DHCP servers into cloud for tenants utilization. Though openstack successfully included baremetal servers into cloud, Cloud Admin should also be able to understand time-to-time baremetal server status, their metrics which is not currently available in openstack. This problem can be solved by monitoring various metrics of baremetal server like network utilization (Tx/Rx), CPU, Memory utilization using Monasca. Neutron ports of type baremetal contains physical switch/port information. From new Monasca plug-in we poll network metrics of physical switch using Netconf/SNMP and populate these metrics in Monasca API.This way User can understand time to time performance of the baremetal based on derived metrics.Monasca configuration will also allows users to specify which servers and metrics to be monitored by Monasca agent.

Migrating legacy workload to openstack lively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At present, openstack has been widely used, but before that many companies have had their own traditional virtualization solution running for long periods. Now these companies want to apply openstack, and at the same time they want previous virtualization solutions to be integrated to and managed by openstack platform, Existing integration solution  is to export original virtual machine as a openstack image, and then import image into openstack platform. There are two problems in this solution, the first is low performance caused by multiple image conversion and image copy, the second is interrupted VM services. we provide our solution to solve them.

Navigating in OpenStack: source of truth about everything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you ever tried, for example,  to find the list of projects to be able to compare them by their role for the ecosystem? How many application catalogs or installation tools do we have? There are a lot of questions related to the entirety of the ecosystem. That’s why we started the project to create an interactive map of projects. We hope that this initiative will be the first step to create the user-friendly navigation system for current experienced Stackers and for new beings. By the way, such a tool is very important thing to attract new members to the OpenStack Community. We already mentioned this point in the article about OpenStack Day in Israel [1]. OpenStack community has an opportunity to find a right way to help everyone to navigate through that maze. And frankly speaking that’s the only chance for all of us to keep growing without losing the general high-level view of the ecosystem.

Nginx in OpenStack:  a High Availability Solution for API services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Apache is the default web server to host Openstack API services, which is running well in small-scale clusters.  When a cluster reaches hundreds of nodes and api reach hundreds of concurrent requests,  shortcomings reveals. It cannot handle so many concurrent requests from external. In Qihoo’s production environments, we use Nginx rather than Apache to host API services, such as nova-api, glance-api, cinder-api and keystone etc. Besides, there are different release versions in a single cluster(for example, we are using the Kilo release of keystone, Liberty of nova, neutron etc.). And different versions depend on different package versions.  To overcome this disgusting problem, we use docker to isolate different versions of API services in a single node. With this solution, we get much better performance than ever on our production environment.

Non-distruptive OpenStack upgrade while skipping a release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the growing adoption of OpenStack in production environments, upgrading deployments is going to be a more relevant topic for operators.We have previously shared our experience with upgrading an Openstack Cloud while skipping a release. While we still follow the same upgrade strategy,  our customers demanded zero downtime of the OpenStack workloads along with skipping a release. This lead to restructuring the upgrade process and formulating a better workflow while making it non-disruptive. This talk gives a technical overview on how we achieved a non disruptive upgrade in an OpenStack Cloud. It will walk through the complete workflow of the process along with the pre-requisites and other requirements. We provide useful hints both for OpenStack operators and future upstream development.

Openstack and Infrastructure High Availability for a Production deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most of the production installations do need High Availability on both openstack side and Infrastructure side. Most of the implementations are done today considering openstack 'is highly available' and will take care of it.This may not be always true. A failure can happen on VM, Server, disk, network, switches anywhere apart from any glitches/bugs with openstack services. A case study of deploying a production openstack with HA and study done by faults injected at component and infra level will be shown.A topology of multiple Cisco UCS Fabrics and domains along with switches in the infra along with multiple controllers, hypervisors and ceph nodes spread across these domains and achieving HA will be revealed.

OpenStack and Magnum: Kubernetes as a Service for everyone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kubernetes is one the major orchestration solutions for Linux containers. It's makes easy to have distributed, self-healing and autoscaling containers clusters.  However operators can have a hard time setting up a Kubernetes cluster. Quite some efforts have to be put in place even for the creation of a simple cluster. Things get even more challenging when security, flexibility and scalability have to be taken into account. And what about making everything automated to satisfy the requests of all the tenants?  Now all developers and operators can run away from this complexity by using the Kubernetes offerings inside of the OpenStack clouds. This talk will show how OpenStack can act as the perfect platform to run Kuberenetes clusters by using the Magnum project. OpenStack Magnum component simplifies the required integration with Kubernetes, and allows for cloud users who can already launch OpenStack resources to also create application containers to run their applications.

In this session, we will install ManageIQ on OpenStack and then look at using ManageIQ from three different perspectives: operators, infrastructure administrators, and end users. From the operator's perspective, we will show how to create service catalogs; user, project, quota, and roles management; and chargebacks based on metrics from OpenStack Ceilometer and service catalogs. We will also demonstrate a typical user's workflow, including lifecycling of resources, scaling resources up and down based on the application's requirement, using service catalogs, and viewing resource and application usage and billing. From the perspective of an infrastructure administrator, we’ll show how to do capacity planning, right sizing, and monitoring and managing resources. You will also learn to query infrastructure capabilities and view system-wide applications usage, chargeback reports, etc.

Openstack Deployment As a Mistral Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack deployment procedure typically involves many tasks. Mistral's model assures a perfect fit for easy management of different tasks within an Openstack deployment workflow. In Mistral , Openstack deployment workflow can be further divided into set of tasks.These tasks can run independently or in parallel.Openstack deployment workflow can further be paused/resumed as required and the tasks can be re-run independently in case of any unseen problems.  Mistral provides a convenient way to manage and debug the tasks, as each of these tasks have their own state and error information.

OpenStack on Kubernetes - Lessons learned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Due to its important number of components, deploying and managing OpenStack is known to be a complex and error-prone process. On the other hand, containers recently introduced consistent deployment capabilities and container management systems brought robust application lifecycle administration at scale. Therefore, we’ve decided earlier this year to bring the worlds of VMs and containers together by containerizing OpenStack services and managing them using Kubernetes. This effort enables companies to deploy a scalable and self-healing OpenStack platform in less than 5 minutes on top of Kubernetes. During this session, we will share the experience that we gained during the kubification of OpenStack, demonstrate how this work simplifies and accelerate OpenStack deployments and operations, and describe how what was initially a proof of concept is growing into a production-ready product.

OpenStack Troubleshooting for beginners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is powerful. And complex. Troubleshooting OpenStack is not always straightforward because the functionality in OpenStack is delivered by several projects/services working together. We believe that while there is a wealth of well-presented documentation on different services in OpenStack there is a clear lack of good knowledge when all the pieces come together in a real world scenario. We believe that with the learnings and experiences we faced in the field on OpenStack deployment we will be able to present the viewer with a clear step by step procedure on tacking most common issues that we face today in OpenStack. This session is going to re-iterate and reinforce the ideas of an experienced OpenStack troubleshooter and will work as a revision session for them.

Operating OpenStack and Docker on a Budget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As you can imagine, life gets busy for a tiny OpenStack team of 2 responsible for 1K+ virtual machines, and growing, and thousands of containers in a multi data-center cloud, while the recommended best practice for admin to VM ratio is closer to 1 to 250. Setting up global monitoring and administration for two multiple centers can be a challenge and a balancing act to meet the requirements for rapid prototyping in Dev/Test environments, as well as the needs for stability required for running traditional workloads like telephony and back-office apps. This session will discuss the transition from a public to a private cloud and how it enables us to do so much more by using the KISS principle, with the same resources yet without over-simplifying our setup. Here we share our best practices and our mistakes that we learned ever since deploying OpenStack Grizzly, all the way to Mitaka. Get a taste of the alphabet soup plunging headlong into the project.

Pitfalls on the way of migrating legacy applications to latest OpenStack (Xenial+Mitaka)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NTT West, Japanese major telecommunication provider company, migrated existing virtualized environment consist from legacy servers and SAN storages to OpenStack Mitaka on Ubuntu16.04 LTS.   This project caused various changes of infrastructure, operation and culture. We focused issues derived by those changes which are conflicts with migration and operation of existing application. To mitigate these issues, we adopt multi vendor Cinder storage and use them as boot volume with multiple AZ. This enables virtual servers to be configured HA cluster with shared volume.We also designed cinder-volume and cinder-backup use cases based on existing backup process.   In this presentation, we introduce issues and resolution not only for migration of legacy application but also caused by using latest version of Mitaka and Ubuntu16.04(Xenial). We also share existing issues and future improvements.

Public Cloud Agility with Your OpenStack Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprise IT organizations have an important strategic goal:  Ensure their private clouds are as agile as public cloud deployments without compromising, security, scale, or performance.  Faced with the demands of application development teams, which require rapid provisioning of infrastructure for test, development and production; IT organizations are wrestling with the above conflicting mandates.  One of the key drivers for the OpenStack platform is to provide an alternative to proprietary ‘lock in’ found in other cloud platforms.  Critical to broad adoption of the OpenStack platform will be HEAT, Murano, and the ability to orchestrate and automate full stack application deployments.

QoS QoS Baby
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Quality of Service (QoS) is typically associated with networking, however it can be applied to all components that make up the cloud infrastructure (i.e. compute, network and storage).  In fact, unless a cloud-wide approach to QoS is taken, enabling QoS features may not have much of an effect on performance. This session will explore the QoS features that are currently available or upcoming in OpenStack, with an eye toward coordinating QoS across the entire cloud infrastructure in order to ensure that the cloud will meet the demands of critical applications.

Rolling upgrade of bare metal Cloud (Ironic)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ironic is now widely used to manage bare metal provisioning in data centers, but large-scale data centers have multiple ironic services (conductor/api) running in a cloud. This causes a serious problem when operators try to upgrade the cloud to the latest version: how to upgrade the cloud with minimal downtime? Because at the moment, ironic only supports a cold upgrade, whereby operators upgrade all ironic services simultaneously, which breaks the service and is time consuming. We propose a rolling upgrade solution to ironic in order to support upgrading ironic services with minimal downtime. In this solution, there is no need to take down all the ironic services and upgrade them at the same time. Operators are able to upgrade ironic services one by one with the rest of the services still available. This provides a better experience for users and operators of the cloud.

Running an OpenStack Public Cloud with a small team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we will talk about how ScaleUp launched a Public Cloud Service based on OpenStack. Initally a commercial stack was used but had license restrictions and lacked scalability and innovation. Since an object based storage service was needed, OpenStack Swift was deployed. The Swift installation was later merged into a new installation for Nova, which replaced the commercial cloud stack. We will talk about how we operate this "Vanilla" OpenStack cloud with a small team.

Simple Scale Test for OpenStack Control Plane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scale testing the OpenStack controller with physical or virtual hosts is not always feasible and is bounded by the resources available. In this talk we dive in to the various steps we followed to scale test the Platform9 Control plane with limited resources.With almost every OpenStack project it is possible to create a fake driver that creates the relevant objects either in memory or as simple files on the filesystem. Scale testing control plane using a fake driver allows creation of many hosts that connect and consume the control messages like a real host. This allows evaluating performance of various api processes, messaging queues and databases with thousands of hosts interacting with the OpenStack.Areas that we will discuss may include - enhancements made to fake driver in nova, implementation of similar fake drivers for cinder and possibly neutron. Other aspects of this talk would include performance metrics that we collected running OpenStack under various load conditions.

Skipping OpenStack Releases: (You Don’t) Gotta Catch ‘Em All
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most of the commonly-deployed OpenStack projects have been using a six-month release cycle for the majority of their existence.  In the early days of OpenStack’s lifetime in particular, a relatively short release cycle made a lot of sense due to the rapid pace of feature addition and new projects joining the fold.  Six years in, OpenStack is now a much more robust, mature platform that has attracted a much more diverse user base.  As the user base has expanded, it’s become apparent that not all operators wish to upgrade their clouds every six months.     Is it really possible to skip upstream releases?  Under what circumstances might you consider doing so, and what issues can you expect to encounter?  How can you orchestrate a skip-release upgrade? In this talk, we’ll dive into our experiences with skipping upstream releases on production clouds.

Supercharging Heat with the Open Patterns Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Heat orchestration templates are very useful on their own, but combine them with Salt for configuration management, Git for source code management, a media library for binary files, a graphical/text editor for your source code, and a runtime management system for "day two" operations and you have something that truly supercharges Heat.  We call this powerful combination of technologies the Open Patterns Engine. By an "open pattern" we are speaking of a means for using open technologies to describe the OS images, application software, configuration management scripts, and orchestration steps that go together to deploy and manage a software stack.  These patterns provide a way to treat infrastructure as code.  We call the engine that interprets these patterns the Open Pattern Engine.  Our presentation will describe and demonstrate how you can put the Open Pattern Engine we've built to use, or learn how you can build a similar one of your own.

The Hybrid Stack - Deploying Applications Across OpenStack, Azure, GCP, VMware and AWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hybrid cloud deployments for the most part rely on a least common denominator approach of abstracting the infrastructure layer and forcing limited use of the underlying cloud infrastructure, especially around compute. This completely defeats the advantage that open source cloud through OpenStack inherently provides, which is exposing all of the underlying APIs to maximize the use of your infrastructure. In order to achieve true hybrid cloud, and expose many of the more advanced features of the underlying infrastructure as well as mission critical services such as database, analytics, and LBaaS, you need to build a hybrid stack with cloud portability in mind. This talk will discuss the current state of hybrid cloud and API abstraction, as well as how to deploy applications across all major clouds without having to compromise on infrastructure layer abstraction.

The Policy Engine: Managing Permissions in OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation explains how to implement proper user- and permission management in OpenStack. Clouds have certain requirements when it comes to user- and permission management: A hard separation of individual projects is necessary — and it must work reliably. In OpenStack, the built-in policy engine is responsible for defining and enforcing access levels. While things seem great at a first glance, a closer look brings a number of challenges to light. This presentation gives a basic introduction into the OpenStack permission model and how policy enforcement works for the individual services. It will elaborate on a number of issues of the current implementation and will show ways to address them. If you want to know why using the OpenStack default policy files may not be a good idea, this presentation is for you.

The Story of booting VM from Ceph RBD volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

eBay has a large scale OpenStack deployment. As a consequence, hypervisor failure is a common thing in daily life. This, in turn, becomes a real harassment for our internal cloud users in terms of VM availability. This talk will go through the overall story of how we address the issue by enabling VM boot from Ceph RBD volume in eBay. In this talk, we will go through different alternatives of booting VM from Ceph storage, the changes we did to make RBD VM as default option based on policy settings (image, flavor, production/dev etc), the challenges along the way and how we managed to fix. In the end, we were able to gradually rollout Ceph RBD based VM in a controlled manner. This talk will also share the latest effort of RBD VM auto-remediation to minimize VM downtime that end users can feel.

Tips and tricks to making your instances highly maintainable and available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Instance migration is a requirement for any highly available OpenStack deployment and can help to significantly reduce downtime for a cloud’s customers. Migration is important for several reasons: During maintenance work, instances need to be moved to different hypervisors. Resource constraints may make it necessary to move virtual machines to specific hardware. Automated solutions are needed to recover instances in case bare metal machines fail without warning. This presentation will explain the differences between the different forms of migration and evacuation. Administrators will learn how to avoid common pitfalls by applying good practices from the start. Troubleshooting migration has its own challenges. Through different use cases, attendees will learn how to identify and fix typical problems which occur before or after failed migrations, such as resource constraints and database problems.

Top Considerations for Migrating Your Databases to OpenStack: Loading Data into Trove
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the challenges faced when migrating data to OpenStack is how to get it into a newly provisioned database. Many database engines have platform-specific tools for loading large amounts of data in a more efficient way than just using inserts. However these tools are often not usable in an OpenStack environment, therefore the solution to loading data into Trove is not a trivial one. This talk will cover the techniques and best practices that can be employed to solve this problem.

Transforming Enterprise IT using OpenStack with Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is not only for cloud native workload. Recently OpenStack has been releasing fantastic capabilities for supporting traditional workload such as VM live migration and Shared File Storage. However, enterprise user is not satisfied only by these features. To operate mission critical workload on OpenStack, we need to develop more functions to keep NFR. e.g. HA cluster support / backup & restore / monitoring. And the client hopes to deploy these features with minimal labor hour. So we need to develop automation solution with OpenStack.This session will provide architecture and operation patterns for hosting traditional enterprise applications into IBM BlueBox Dedicated on SoftLayer with fully automation.This session is based on a real transformation case.

Vendor-neutral distributed Multi-Site OpenStack cloud architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many customers today are looking for distributed OpenStack cloud architecture spread across multiple data centers. Key aspect is vendor-neutral and no lock-in cloud. The solution is to have the OpenStack control plane with required common services in each data center and have a separate region for each vendor. Each region runs OpenStack services like Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Heat etc. from any of the OpenStack vendors and these services will be registered in common Keystone. Another approach is to have two independent clouds running OpenStack, with federated Keystone services which will be LDAP or AD integrated.

Volkswagen Car Configurator: Running Cloud-Friendly Applications on OpenStack in the Real World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When was the last time you saw a true cloud-native application in the wild? How about in the wilderness that is a large enterprise? Enterprises are adopting cloud technologies in the context of larger operational and organizational transformations. As they undergo these changes their architects and developers must find ways to conform to IT constraints and leverage the data assets extant in their environments during the transition. Enterprise IT cannot adopt wholesale cloud native architectures because applications must use the enormous amounts of critical data that only exists in legacy systems. In this talk we’ll use the example of Volkswagen’s Car Configurator to explore how Volkswagen has leveraged OpenStack to bridge the legacy world into the cloud, utilizing data services, continuous delivery, software defined load-balancing, and other techniques to enable agile response to business needs.

Who are you? Leveraging OpenStack Identity to enable Federation, Policy and Custom Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You've heard of OpenStack features like Keystone Federation, Policy and Middleware, but how can you leverage these features in your own environments? IBM Blue Box has a long history of enabling and operationalizing OpenStack features, and have made use of these constructs to deliver reliable, compliant IaaS solutions for our customers. In this session we will remove the theory behind these OpenStack constructs and demonstrate, in a real, practical manner, how you can leverage these OpenStack Identity components to enforce corporate security policies as well as enable new features. Attendees will walk away with a first-hand accounts of how to shape OpenStack into the cloud your customers demand. Specifically, we will dive deep into how Keystone Federation is implemented and operationalized, how service policies cant be hammered into shape, and how you can easily impement your own custom middleware to enable new features and further extend your custom OpenStack offering.

You Got Your Cloud in My Mainframe!  Confessions of a 3rd-Party CI Operator & Enterprise Consultant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We've seen patterns emerge in mainframe cloud deployments, and from running our Third-Party CI system.   OpenStack on z/VM runs the hundreds of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE VMs in the LinuxONE Community Cloud ... and its OpenStack controller... on a single system.   Our CI system runs 20 tempest runs in parallel, with 4 x86 blades all pounding away at a single system.   Our enterprise users include major banks, insurance companies, payroll processors, healthcare providers, and IT service providers.   We'll share things we've learned along the way about playing nice with what-is in the enterprise, scaling compute nodes, and images that go Bump! in the night.


* **John Arwe** *(I've grunged around in the mainframe kernels (z/OS SRM/WLM mostly, recently a bit of z/VM and zKVM) for many years, and took a wide detour doing standards and open source work (W3C SML and LDP, OSLC, OASIS, DMTF, Eclipse, REST APIs, Linked Data) in the middle.

Your Cloud Architecture in Yoga Pants: Staying Flexible Over Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today OpenStack has become a powerful, extremely flexible platform that can fit a lot of different needs and use cases. There are specialized OpenStack deployments for NFV and for e-commerce. Clouds that host production workloads and clouds intended for developers. But most OpenStack clouds whether big or small have one trait in common: they change. More often than not, OpenStack clouds grow as they pick up new workloads. They add or swap out hardware and upgrade underpinning software.  They get tasked with new requirements or different constraints around uptime or performance.  They add new projects from upstream, or change backends for existing projects.  Given time, almost every dimension of an OpenStack cloud is subject to change. So since there’s no one-size-fits-all deployment architecture, it’s clear that you’ll need your cloud to evolve with you In this talk, we’ll dive into our experiences with changing deployment architecture on production clouds.

A Cloudy Forecast - Contributing Vendor Drivers to Upstream OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack was designed and built for cloud, but existing deployments in many data centers are a bit more traditional. As operators work to converge cloud infrastructure, integrating with these platforms is key to simplifying data centers around the world. Fortunately OpenStack has a broad, extensible driver model to support vendors contributing for their platforms upstream - but that doesn't always make those initial contributions seem easy! In this session we'll discuss the path we took while contributing support for a traditional platform to various upstream OpenStack projects, how we changed our platform to integrate with upstream technologies, the challenges and rewards, and provide tips to help navigate upstream.

Cutting Some Slack: Decoding IRC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

IRC is the chat solution of choice for many free/open source projects, including OpenStack. It's freely licensed. It's free to use. It's free (as in puppy) to set up and maintain. It's discoverable. If you want to communicate with people on OpenStack projects you need to learn how to use IRC. Unfortunately, much of the criticism of IRC is true: It's an arcane system, and unfortunately it's one whose documentation was mostly written ages ago by people who didn't have usability or UX in mind. Even with those docs, there is a lot of tribal knowledge locked in the brains of the grey haired members of open source, making it more difficult to get started using the technology. This talk will demystify IRC and make it almost as easy (and maybe even as enjoyable) as using a different chat system. You'll learn how to get connected and find channels, how to claim your nickname, how to navigate the enigmatic social mores, and more!

Have It Your Way: Maximizing Drive-Thru Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

They drop by, they fix their particular problem, they leave. They're the drive-through contributor. While, yes, we all would prefer that these people stick around and join the OpenStack community, there's no denying that a good drive-thru contribution adds value to your project. A strong argument can be made that the more drive-thru contributors your project has, the healthier the project process and ecosystem. It shows that you've set up a process which is easy to understand, easy to follow, and which makes it easy to contribute. In a situation like that, it increases the opportunities for new contributors to become new community members and everyone is a winner. This talk will present: * Reasons people become drive-thrus (both why they show up & why they leave)* Methods for maximizing drive-thru contributions* Overall advantages of those methods for your project* An argument for using number of drive-thru contributions as a metric for project health

How to Become an Advanced Contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the fastest growing open source project supported by a large community base with a wide variety of skills. For a new contributor, the journey from figuring out how to get started to becoming a valued member of a team might seem daunting and not so obvious. Most projects have very good documentation on how to get started and how to contribute, but beyond that how can one become a valued member and improve visibility beyond just code contributions? In this presentation, we will try to address these questions based on our own OpenStack journey and we will share what we learnt during the process including tools, tips and general advice on how to contribute to any project. The presenters for this talk are Trevor McCasland, an amatuer member from the OpenStack Mentoring program and active contributor to the Trove and Neutron project and Mariam John who is a core on the Trove project.

**Abstract:**

Abstract: Starting a new project in OpenStack is so amazing, motivating, and generates such enthusiasm, faith and positive feelings.  After all, we create software that will be used by many thousands of people and have the unique opportunity to make open source better.  However, we need to focus on some good execution execution to be successful. Topics: -          Understanding if your idea is really needed -          Alone... you won't go that far... -          Community is important. Ask and the answer is yours -          Helpful for manies is more relevant than helpful only for your Company -          Community rules and WoW: Sooner the better -          Core Contrib and PTL: Yourself as a Service

Is OpenStack Facing The Tragedy of the Commons?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Tragedy of the Commons describes a shared-resource situation where individuals acting according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good and depleting the resources. Open Source project like OpenStack are similar share-resource situations - community, code, intellectual property and even brand are all commonly-held resources that members participate in the development and take advantage of the resources in support of a common good. OpenStack is commercialized by many vendors often pulling in directions, often perceived as contrary to common good. Is there a way we tell when this is happening by looking at the development practices and apply data analytics to identify when this is or is not occurring? In this talk, we take a look at the data behind the project(s) that make up OpenStack, look for signs of metric gamification, company-driven auto-reviews, and other indicators of self-interest driven software practices.

Names, not Numbers: Becoming a Respected OpenStack Contributor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Anyone can be an OpenStack contributor but what does it take to be a respected OpenStack contributor? You’ve been fixing all of the low-hanging-fruit bugs that you could get your hands on, plus-one-ing like nobody’s business, and you’re in all of the IRC chat rooms. But you still feel like you aren’t quite part of the OpenStack Community. What do you do now that you’re comfortable with the processes involved to take your contributions to the next level?

OpenStack by the Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Gerrit and git provide a vast wealth of data about the history of change proposals, commits, and reviews. There are a few existing tools to visualize the statistics provided by these tools. The existing tools aren't very good at painting the greater picture or analyzing the trends around contribution. In this session, we'll look at larger trends in the data and what the data can tell us about changes in project growth rates and charting the shifting focus of developers and reviewers over time. Let's look at some pretty graphs and analyze the story the statistics tell us about OpenStack and the projects that comprise it.

Pushing your QA upstream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Quality Assurance (QA) is an extremely important part of the software development process nowadays. OpenStack is not different and has a growing set of tools and infrastructure to improve its quality: integration tests (tempest and tempest plugins), performance tests (rally) and a great CI (zuul). In this talk, you will learn why you should push your QA tests upstream and how to do it, including: adding a gate job, adding tests to it, creating a custom DevStack deployment and circumventing possible limitations.

Rock the (dev) docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As developers and support team members, operators and hobbyists, you routinely communicate your expert product knowledge as you work. First time contributors are always encouraged to commit to the documentation. This is because it is a fast, efficient, and effective way for new contributors to learn how to contribute and take a look at what OpenStack projects are working on currently. In a nutshell: Software documentation is an integral part of any software development process. OpenStack manuals has a strict set of conventions which each new contributor follows, just as each development project has a set of guidelines for any code patches. So let’s extend these guidelines to each project’s developer documentation. In this session I will cover: How to start with your first dev doc commit How to structure your developer documentation for the best usability and readability How to ensure you are following the documentation guidelines How to move beyond your initial contribution

The ABCs of Becoming an OpenStack ATC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What does it mean to be an OpenStack active technical contributor? It means that you are a developer or designer or support engineer or tester or project manager or writer or END USER and you’d like to become involved in an open source project. It means that you want contribute to a specific project within OpenStack, like TripleO, which is a project within the umbrella space, and that you’ll join the RDO community for guidance, feedback, and support. And, sure, while it’s actually more like ABCDEF, GEE, I'm hoping you'll enjoy this overview of OpenStack and what it is to become an ATC.

The Struggle - Managing Open Source and Proprietary Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With impending deadlines, limited resources, and upset managers, we must focus most of our time on proprietary projects while still maintaining activity in the OpenStack Community. It honestly is a constant struggle, but many of us have found ways to maintain activity without affecting our personal lives. This panel will go over how it is being done today. As services evolve, companies must determine what goes in OpenSource and what to keep proprietary. We will go over what can and can’t be contributed, what must remain intellectual property, and how can intellectual property be licensed for use in an OpenSource Project. This panel will go over the following topics: How different OpenStack Developers maintain active in the Community, while working on proprietary items. Intellectual Property: What can and cannot be contributed. How non-developers(Project Managers) are involved in the community. Stigma behind developer vs documentation contributions.

The Vitrage Story: from Nothing to the Big Tent in Six Months
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The story of how CloudBand took Vitrage from nothing to the Big Tent in just six months. Way back when, around 6 months ago, a few CloudBand developers realized that RCA had been overlooked in OpenStack. They decided to work it up in python, and put together the basic code for what is now known as Vitrage – an RCA and Deduced Alarms service that supplies insights about OpenStack. Vitrage was first introduced to the OpenStack community at the Tokyo summit – we came with diagrams, our experience from CloudBand and a lot of passion. We met key OpenStack people from various projects, who realized there was a real need for this, and we got their blessing. This is a story of going from an idea to a concept to a working code to a community and to becoming officially part of OpenStack – all this in record time. We will describe the steps we took along the way, the decision points, the failures and successes that led us along this route. This is a story for anyone dreaming about the Big Tent.


* **Ifat Afek** *(Ifat Afek is a System Architect in Nokia CloudBand, and the PTL of Vitrage project - OpenStack RCA service for organizing, analyzing and visualizing OpenStack Alarms and Events.

Using Magit to supercharge your Git work flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Beyond creating content, new contributors to OpenStack frequentlystruggle with Git operations. Magit (https://magit.vc/) is an opensource, streamlined interface to Git implemented within Emacs. (Youcan still use any editor to create your code/content.) Magit providesan easy to use, intuitive, and yet very powerful wrapper around Gitthat can help new contributors over the hurdle of making effectivecontributions to OpenStack. Experienced users will love the powerfulfeatures and ability to directly call advanced Git commands and seeverbose status.

Why contributing to OpenStack makes you a better developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will provide a detailed picture of what developers can learn by contributing upstream and how this can benefit their employers and downstream work.In our experience, joining the OpenStack community by contributing upstream makes you a better developer by improving both your technical and non-technical skills. This is something that can often be overlooked. It is easy to think of upstream development only in terms of features added or lines of code. But it's more than that. It's a chance to grow and gain experience by collaborating with subject matter experts from around the world.We will describe how you will learn from the technology, development and test methodologies OpenStack uses. How OpenStack development tooling "automates all the things". How strong review processes lead not just to better code, but better coders. How to collaborate and reach consensus with developers distributed across geographies -- with a healthy culture of respect.

Arrebol: easy and efficient execution of Bag-of-Task applications on federated clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We present Arrebol, a service for the easy execution of Bag-of-tasks (BoT) applications in private, public and hybrid clouds. Arrebol provides an intuitive scripting language to define large BoT jobs in a succinct way. Using a command line interface, users can submit jobs to the Arrebol submission service. It parses the jobs and interacts with the underlying cloud to create the infrastructure required to run them. Then, it submits tasks to execute in parallel, and dismantles the infrastructure when it is no longer needed, making the management of the execution of jobs completely transparent to the users. BoT applications are ideally suited to be executed over elastic cloud infrastructures. We also discuss how Arrebol leverages Fogbow, a middleware for federating clouds, to increase the capacity of the infrastructure by exploiting different hybrid settings, including cloudbursting and cloud federation. Both Arrebol and Fogbow are available as open source under Apache 2.0 license.

Bridging Parallel File Systems with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) there are many types of File Systems. LANL has Lustre, GPFS, NFS as well as various other file systems available. The management of all this data can be an onerous task. In many environments external to LANL, automatic tiering mechanisms are utilized to migrate data to other storage systems based on storage policies. LANL takes a different approach to data management. In our use case the user manages and migrates the data around manually using File Transfer Agents (FTAs). In this talk, I will discuss how LANL will use OpenStack to deploy and manage this type of cluster. I will go over motivations, as well as lessons learned, and advantages of this approach.

Chameleon: Building a Computer Science Testbed with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Chameleon testbed provides a platform for computer science research. To support a wide range of repeatable experiments, it provides capabilities such as deep reconfigurability and exclusive resource access. These features are mainly implemented with OpenStack software, in particular Ironic for bare-metal deployment and Blazar for resource reservation. Chameleon went public in July 2015 and currently supports 800+ users as well as many exciting cloud computing research and education projects. This talk will present the internal architecture of Chameleon and especially how Nova, Ironic, and Blazar interact together to provide Chameleon's core capabilities. We will share our experience with running OpenStack and identify planned upstream developments that are important for Chameleon.

**Abstract:**

This session will teach you how you can use OpenStack, Heat, (and Ceph) to offer your users the ability to create complex, reproducible, extendible, clustered infrastructures, in minutes, at a push of a button. We call our approach Cluster-as-a-Service and we happen to use it for offering our users self-managed and fully monitored virtualized services like Hadoop, Spark, OpenStack, HPC, all in a as-a-Service manner. But you can use this, or a similar, approach for offering whatever you want.

Docker Storage Support for Reproducible and Secure Scientific Computing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Performing scientific computing in OpenStack clouds is enabling greater collaboration among researchers.  While this is enabling more science than ever before, there are still several storage challenges including application portability, multi-tenancy and performance.  By introducing Docker, scientists can create a single portable package that encompasses all of their application dependencies, allowing scientists to share their applciations. Docker also solves many storage challenges in a scientific cloud by itsolating tenants from each other while allowing their applications to come and go with no impact to the storage subsystem.

Driving Science in the Hybrid Cloud with Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running HPC workloads entirely in public clouds presents a challenge because of the high cost of both the CPU/memory resources and the intensive data movement and storage requirements.  OpenStack provides the private cloud component of a hybrid cloud HPC strategy that not only accommodates a wider range of applications than specialized clusters but also reduces costs by running steady state workloads on premise and “bursting” into a public cloud.  Ansible provides the mechanism to create and maintain HPC clusters across clouds. This presentation covers impediments to doing traditional HPC workloads in a hybrid cloud and ways to mitigate them.  We present and demonstrate a set of Ansible playbooks to create a virtual cluster across clouds (OpenStack and AWS), connect them together, then provision storage and scheduler.  Finally, we discuss running analytics, genomics, and computational chemistry workloads in a hybrid cloud environment.

High Performance Computing - Ironically not just for baremetal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

High Performance Compute (HPC) environments are used across many different types of business and range in size from a handful of nodes to thousands of nodes. Some companies run their HPC in the public cloud, some run in in their own private cloud, and some have to do a mix of both. Monitoring and orchestrating the size of these clusters can be done using a cloud management platform (CMP). In this session, we will present a reference architecture that leverages several different products, including OpenStack and Ansible, to help monitor your HPC clusters and scale them up or down as the current load dictates. Since this is all open source and we all like choices, you can mix and match components into your final solution. Don't want to rely on Heat for software config? We'll let Ansible handle that. Don't want to worry about a different method for scaling each provider? We'll use a CMP, such as ManageIQ, to help decide which provider to use and orchestrate the actual deployment.

HPC, Unikernels and OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session explains lessons learned integrating HPC workloads with unikernels on top of OpenStack. HPC workloads are traditionally executed in general purpose operating systems running directly on the host. Virtualized and containerised environments using these base systems are being adopted to improve flexibility and manageability of the infrastructure. To this end, the MIKELANGELO project is using a lightweight unikernel (OSv) providing bare minimum, but fully virtualized environment to these workloads. We are going to present a flexible application management that has been implemented specifically to support integration with cloud middlewares, such as OpenStack. This allows dynamic composition and execution of workloads based on user's needs. OpenFOAM CFD is being used to showcase our approach, including an integration into OpenStack dashboard. Finally, we will show how the use of a flexible telemetry system delivers in-depth insights into the infrastructure and application.

Hybrid HPC on OpenStack – Virtualization, bare metal, containers and micro-services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session we will examine the technology and use cases behind hybrid HPC on OpenStack. We will cover traditional virtualized design as well as requirements / considerations for incorporating hybrid functions, i.e. bare metal, containers and micro-services, for HPC workloads on OpenStack. We will also examine and answer related concerns and questions, such as: What are the performance returns of bare metal vs. virtualization? What are the feature / function losses when deploying on bare metal, e.g. networking, security groups, etc.? What functions are good candidates for micro-services, e.g. temporary PVFS, data transfer nodes, etc.? How do you segregate or associate tenants, instances, flavors, workloads, etc. across multiple platforms behind the same control plane? We will cover technical depth of why / how an organization may choose to leverage multi-platform capabilities for HPC as well as best practice approaches to deploying and maintaining these environments.

Image is Everything: Dynamic HPC VM Repositories using Murano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As part of an effort to expand access to computing resources, the (US) National Science Foundation XSEDE project has funded several new computational resources with cloud provisioning capabilities – Bridges and JetStream. To facilitate sharing and reuse of scientific applications, an XSEDE Cloud Virtual Machine Repository has been proposed. Traditional delivery of applications involved monolithic images that requires development, construction, testing, maintenance, vetting, and cataloging of cloud virtual machine images which are non­trivial tasks. One solution is to use Murano, Heat, and cloud-init scripts to deliver scientific applications on a small number of generic images from Linux distribution maintainers rather than images. The use of standard OpenStack components makes the application repository usable by any standard OpenStack deployment. The details of construction, use, and highlights of a few selected applications will be covered.

Lustre Integration for HPC on OpenStack at Cambridge and Monash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Take a survey of scientific computing practitioners for a definition of HPC and you will undoubtedly end up with a broad picture encompassing various shapes, sizes and domains of individual and ensemble jobs. Ask about the storage needed to support these workloads and you’ll find they all need a high-performance filesystem (HPFS) designed for parallel access. OpenStack is now a hot topic in the HPC world. Whether it’s using OpenStack as a bare-metal provisioning service or looking to offer a flexible, integrated IaaS close to primary HPC. However, the question of how to integrate a HPFS with OpenStack is not yet well answered. Little wonder it was one of the priority areas surfaced by the Scientific WG in Austin. In this talk architects and operators from Cambridge University in the UK and Monash University in Australia will explain their approaches to integrating Lustre and OpenStack, the tradeoffs involved, the gaps remaining, and share performance data.

Openstack and Ceph used in large scale cancer research projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will describe how OICR created the Cancer Genome Collaboratory, a highly-available OpenStack and Ceph environment that can scale up to 3000 cores and 15 PB object storage. The design goals and trade-offs required will be discussed. The Collaboratory currently stores 500 TB of genomic data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) in a triple-replicated object store, and the dataset is expected to grow to 5 PB by 2018.  Software optimized for Ceph storage was developed to authenticate and provide data access to only authorized users.  One project as an early user of the Collaboratory is the PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, one of the world's largest cancer data analysis initiative exploring the whole genomes from over 2800 patients across 20 tumor types. The use case further drove the development of the ICGC Data Portal for searching data (https://dcc.icgc.org/repositories), and the development of Dockstore for sharing workflows as docker containers.

Realities at a National Lab -- Caring for your HPC Pets with a Cattle Prod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack drives the promise of an HPC cluster manager integrated with in-house virtualization infrastructures. Except our expectations were immediately brought back to earth at the first attempt to integrate an Ironic-deployed cluster with existing infrastructure services. We, at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Laboratories, suffered with deployment tools and documentation written for cloud environments, not our own data centers and HPC workflows. We needed the cluster to integrate with high performance network infrastructures and shared parallel filesystems, and to be able to build the images without internet connectivity. Finally after streamlining our own processes, we have some pain-saving advice to share with the community. In this talk we review deployment tools such as Kolla and openstack-ansible, as well as image building tools for HPC clusters. We compare the tools with an eye toward flexibility, and whether they were able accommodate our environments. LA-UR-16-24899

The Silent Cloud Majority: Making Life Sciences Excel With OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Researchers in the Life Sciences have historically used traditional bare-metal scheduled environments for computationally-intensive work. Increasingly those who maintain infrastructure for such users are provisioning private clouds using OpenStack. Unlike the canonical cloud use-case of a database-backed web service, which can fairly easily adapt to infrastructure as a service and take the best advantage of its strengths, scientists have a large hinterland of code written for a different world. In this presentation we discuss the challenges, both technological and cultural, of running Life Sciences codes on OpenStack clouds and how we overcame them. Topics covered include shared filesystems for instances, the crucial importance of third-party tools to make successful use of a cloud, and how to bridge the impedance mismatch between users' expectations and the reality of using OpenStack. We also consider longer-term questions of directly adapting applications for running on OpenStack.

Using OmniPath fabric in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads require a balance of computation, memory access and inter-node communication. Efficient memory access may require understanding low-level memory topology, including non-uniform memory accesses for SMP systems (NUMA). For optimal communication inside HPC cluster fabric interconnection solutions, like Intel's OmniPath, are used. Cloud computing traditionally use Ethernet-based solutions and SW-defined networking for communication. Is it possible to merge the flexibility of cloud solutions with the performance of bare metal cluster? In our presentation will show experience with using OmniPath in OpenStack. Performance results for HPC benchmarks executed on virtual machines are presented and compared with the same benchmark results obtained on the bare metal. Guidelines and examples, how to configure virtual environment, including OmniPath interfaces and NUMA nodes, to get the optimal performance results for HPC workloads are presented

“Spartan”, a HPC - Cloud Hybrid: Delivering Performance and Flexibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Spartan is a new breed of HPC; not a cluster but service that manages underlying clusters.  These clusters include high performance bare-metal as well as generic cloud based VMs, and many options in between. It is designed to reduce the time to output for the research community, by providing the most appropriate environment for each specific workload. Because Spartan has virtualized management and login nodes, it can easily migrate hosts as new hardware is deployed, with partitions expanding according to actual demand, rather than anticipated usage.  The totally modular approach eliminates the need for forklift upgrades, as Spartan the service will long outlive the original hardware that supports it.

A Tale of Deploy Tools - Choosing The Right OpenStack Deployment Tool For You (and Your Users)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

They say knowing is half the battle, but when it comes to OpenStack deployment tools it can certainly seem like more than that. Deciding which tool is the right one is challenging for both operators deploying clouds and developers looking to integrate upstream. In this session we work to cut through the noise and provide our view of the ups and downs of a few major upstream deployment tools such as Ansible, Chef and Puppet - as well as some of the OpenStack Deployment projects that use them. Along the way we'll share our experiences both picking a tool to support and contributing back to OpenStack-Ansible to create value for us and the upstream community.

Anti-Pattern Bingo: Enabling Stateful Windows Desktops in an OpenStack fabric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Can you take advantage of all of our investment in an OpenStack cloud for running persistent Windows VDI, one of the most cloud-foreign workloads available? What are the opportunities you would gain and do they outweigh the problems you will create?  How can you compare this offering against an alternative engineered solution or an existing business deployment?  Does the customer have to change their preferred tools for consuming this solution or can they integrate those into this new offering? If we embrace diversity in our platform can we support some of the most inelastic, fragile, stateful and tightly coupled services that are run today without compromising the integrity of our cloud. Diversity  Comparing KVM versus Hyper-V  Scaling service capabilities (Resiliency, Recovery) based on flavor    Hyper-V Replica, Storage Spaces DirectTestability  Objective analysis using RallyCustomer Experience  Interoperability with extensible virtual workspace management systemsWhat’s next?

Application Development Strategies for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is uniquely positioned to offer a distributed application platform for ISVs to target new and existing applications for. With an ever growing catalog of public and private clouds using OpenStack, and a market forecasted to reach $2.7B by 2017, the OpenStack ecosystem presents a vast greenfield for application deployment. This presentation covers a number of strategies for bringing applications to OpenStack, including delivering applications on private OpenStack infrastructures for enterprise customers, hosting applications on public clouds, and delivering Software as a Service (SaaS) on private clouds. Drawing from a mix of real-world applications, analyst studies in application adoption trends, and application developer tools and best practices, you will leave this talk with an argument for the strategic importance of deploying your applications on OpenStack, and an understanding of the available tools to start building and porting your applications.

Beware the Pitfalls when migrating to Hybrid Cloud with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Companies are on longer asking if they should move to the cloud. They’re asking how to migrate to hybrid cloud with OpenStack. A hybrid cloud can offer a company the best of both public and private cloud, meet the requirements such as Cloud bursting, Disaster Recovery, Lifecycle-based Deployment, etc. But not if you slip into one of these pitfalls. Visibility: how to manage clouds with a single pane? Access Control: how to handle different credentials with security manner? Network Connectivity: how to manage network configurations and maintain connectivity across clouds? Outage & DR: how to ensure hybrid applications stay up during one cloud outages? Audit & Compliance: how to collect audit data and comply with regulations? Some OpenStack projects/features like tacker, tricircle, freezer, federated identity, sso, etc have collaborated to address these problems.

Big Data Orchestration: Make the Cloud Ready for IoT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are Big Data systems ready for the cloud? Aren't they just pet applications? Big Data systems are among the most demanding applications that can be run on a IaaS Cloud platform. They have special requirements for storage and network in particular and react sensitive on latency and bandwidth variations. A possible solution would be to consume Big Data as a Service, but this lacks security and flexibility, making it necessary for tenants to setup and operate their big data processing systems on their own. Running it within the cloud as a virtualized workload seems like the way to go, but it poses real challenges to cloud orchestration systems, because of it's special needs. This can result in subpar performance, because the placement of resources may not be optimal according to storage characteristics. This talk shows possible optimizations for OpenStack clouds and in particular how to optimize the orchestration of storage to fulfill the needed characteristics.

Cloud Strategies for Greater Business Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Working with International Data Corporation (IDC), we have analyzed over 6100 organizations across 31 countries. This massive body of research has allowed us to distill the latest cloud market trends. We have also been able to correlate progressive adoption of cloud technologies (private, public or hybrid) with business outcomes and measured the impact that optimized cloud strategies can have on a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). To make this information actionable we have developed the Cisco Business Cloud Advisor (BCA) framework, which allows you to evaluate cloud environments following proven vendor agnostic methodologies. The intent is to provide concrete guidance on what you need to do to implement the right cloud strategy for your business. During this session we will review some of the market research findings and discuss the Cisco BCA framework components and deliverables that can help you continuously optimize your cloud environments.

Defining the Common Operating Model enables the Cloud Management Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing the cloud requires adoption of a Common Operating Model (COM) that takes into consideration a multitude of factors such as the strategic vision and business priorities set forth by leadership. It also requires both business and technical architecture to translate the strategic vision into new solution capabilities and services in the cloud. Implementing a DevOps approach is fundamental for building cloud-native application workloads but it also breaks down the siloed organization trenches so that delivery is integrated and continuous. The COM promotes a service orientation to deliver operationally with greater agility and scalability, with minimal to no interruption, maximum control, and a strong performance orientation that meets the competitive market head on.

Don't run your OpenStack as a cottage industry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Often when first setting a Private Cloud organisations are investigating the art of the possible and not necessarily thinking of the service going into full production, but ideally one should expect that investment to pay and soon be a harness carrying essential business services to deliver long term success. Once services do become production ready and bring value to organisations all the traditional concerns of the Operations teams suddenly start to matter, because even if your cloud services are highly dynamic and agile the infrastructure foundation needs to be ROCK solid. See how distribution vendors help you in the search for a platform which won't fear!

Escaping the Debt Monster: The Case for Creating an OpenStack Community Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the Lead over AT&T’s newly established “OpenStack Community Program” the presenter will explore the strategy for making the case to fund a team of upstream OpenStack Community Contributors and the resulting trials and travails of succeeding! We will cover key principals of the business case, strategy for getting 'buy in', communicating seemingly bizarre new concepts to executives (hint: use trendy buzz words) and the myriad challenges of ‘breaking new ground’. We will NOT cover the typical boring recruit, train, manage stuff. Rather, dotted with amusing anecdotes, we’ll explore the far more fascinating facets of the building phase like Intellectual Property Lawyers wanting to review every commit for ‘patent potential’, a Finance org that funds you with Capital $ (not Expense), never before considering that software which the company never owns, can’t be depreciated, or how to generate a ‘model driven estimate’ for a team that has NO deliverables beyond ‘growing their influence’!

Fitting OpenStack into your environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When we first test and pilot OpenStack, it often runs in isolation in a separate infrastructure -- i.e., "shadowed" IT. However, as we expand the scope of OpenStack deployment and start to use it in production, it needs to work with your existing operation tools and process and within your existing infrastructure. In this session, we’ll look at how we can fit OpenStack into your IT environment. We’ll also provide management views into both OpenStack and other infrastructure managers, such as vCenter, etc. You’ll also see a demo of how we provide a management view to help manage and automate OpenStack with other infrastructure components.

Go below the surface of the Iceberg : IBM Systems strategy with OpenStack update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will discuss the IBM systems support of Open Stack, from what are the IBM systems to how OS is supported.Since many yeasr IBM has been a strong supporter of Open Stack in terms of software investment, but most people may have missed the internal change that happened to have all IBM systems support OpenStack, as controlled nodes (or controllers), providing OpenSTack APIs to any used willing to transform their existing systems to a OpenStack self-service IT without loosing the benefits of their existing investments. We will review how this transformation was made , the recent changes, what systems can be intregrated how, and discuss evolutions coming from client requests. This is right middle of the hybrid cloud solutions: vertical hybrids, horizontal hybrids… and the concepts of using different infrastructures for different tasks: why clients want to do this ?

Networking technology offers so many areas for advancement and investment, and so many demands on limited developer resources; So, why not put IPv6 deployment off for … just another six months? Two new entrants into the technology arena are Big Data and IoT. IoT Cloud is driving large-scale compute environments that may finally promote IPv6 from “that sounds great” to a mandatory RFP checkbox - for Telcos, Cloud Service Providers, and Enterprises alike.  While the promise of IPv6 has been clear for years, the reality of implementation will bring a new set of technical challenges, and require increased networking expertise and protocol knowledge from its implementers. In other words, it won’t be easy. A few topics we will explore in this session are: Cost of doing business in an IPv6 environment The impact of IPv6 adoption on the business of cloud provisioning The importance of an end-to-end IPv6 story for Cloud adoption

Is OpenStack ready for Pets (Traditional Enterprise Workloads)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises today run most of their business on existing traditional applications. Re-designing these applications for cloud computing is a trans-formative journey that could yield significant benefits, though would take significant time and investment that most enterprises don’t have the luxury of.So enterprises are looking at migrating traditional workloads from their existing environments to an unified cloud environment. In the last few releases, OpenStack has moved the needle in the right direction to enable enterprise workloads in the cloud. In this presentation, we will explore how OpenStack addresses or plans-to-address the following four aspects that come up on top in our customer conversations - Deployment - Storage- High Performance and Scale- Business Continuity

Is your cloud scaling forecast a bit foggy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack clouds are typically designed once and grown over time. There are different schools of thought about how growth is triggered and executed, but historically, a lot of guesswork is involved, especially in environments where change and procurement can not be run at a moment's notice. On the other hand, the OpenStack cloud provides a large amount of internal data, which is typically not seen by management, but allows forecasting of requirements for growth and change if harnessed correctly. This is where the new project WeatherStation comes in. Complementary to monitoring tools such as StackLight, WeatherStation provides management with the equivalent of the data the monitoring tool provides to the engineers and operators, but instead of an 'at the moment' view it focuses on forecasting using the relevant data to equip management with the necessary data to keep up with cloud growth and also provides relevant business data for future project decisions.

Making the Grade: Cloud Thrives in the API Economy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Modern organizations rely on many applications; levels of integration tighten across platforms, solutions offer a progressively complex ecosphere of business processes, services, and endpoints. This is a force behind businesses adoption of cloud computing. The strength of cloud is the Application Programing Interface (API); it permeates existing and new services, it offers opportunity for innovation with advanced technology along with new monetary prospects. APIs are enablement tools; by encapsulating transaction processes and integrating communication across a disparately wide ecosystem of diverse technology solutions. Strategically, APIs may seem like a silver bullet but it requires planning and effort to achieve nirvana. Start with evaluation of the business needs. Understand existing technology asset inventories to determine what is cloud-ready, cloud capable, and what can be transformed as well as the hard decision about what gets left behind.

Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 1.5, Pets, Cattle: How to tame the menagerie with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enterprises are faced with the challenge of embracing modern cloud native apps to stay competitive and deliver business value faster, while simultaneously having to maintain several traditional IT business critical apps. Keeping aside the discussion of whether we need 2 models of IT (Bimodal), the reality is that enterprises are looking for better automation and improved efficiency to be successful in the market. By supporting both traditional and modern cloud native apps, OpenStack can enable effective automation of both and possibly provide a path for migrating apps from the traditional model to the modern cloud native model. This talk will explore the various challenges that enterprises face today as they adopt the cloud native paradigm, propose how OpenStack can be used to address each of these challenges, provide concrete recommendations with use-cases and examples, and show a demo of how tools built on OpenStack can provide effective automation for traditional and modern apps.

Navigating infrastructure choices: What workloads are best suited for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Confusion often emerges when decisions hinge on what workloads are ideally suited for OpenStack. Stateful versus Stateless? Traditional versus Cloud Native? Pets versus Cattle? Ephemeral versus long lasting? The choices get further complicated when considering the many infrastructure choices that exist - bare metal servers, virtualized infrastructure in the form of hypervisors, Linux containers, private clouds (e.g., OpenStack), and public clouds. Are all of these mutually exclusive? Are there architectures that should combine these choices - e.g., containers on Nova instances? In this session we will explore the solution use cases and the attributes that must be properly considered to identify when and where OpenStack makes the most sense. A decision framework will be presented to assist IT organizations in the workload mapping process that is a critical aspect of both architecture and infrastructure planning activities.

Nurturing your OpenStack. PaaS and CMP, proteins and vitamins for your IaaS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is already being deployed almost everywhere, however, not in many enterprises the value that IaaS provides is being obtained. Testing environments, basic big data workloads or niche workloads, such as SSL frontend offloading, are the most widespread uses it is receiving. It is possible to add muscle to your deployment by addressing an important wide number of use cases by deploying OpenShift as a PaaS on top of your OpenStack adding more muscle to it. To achieve better integration among PaaS and IaaS, and at the very same time reach legacy systems and increase control and management a Cloud Management Platform can provide the vitamins needed to enhance the IaaS capabilities, make it stretch beyond its current reach and keep it healthy and under control.

Practical OpenStack Interoperability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In 2015, The OpenStack Powered trademark program relaunched with new testing guidelines to guarantee a basic level of compatibility and interoperability between clouds with the OpenStack Powered trademark. Over a year into the relaunch, we now have over 40 public clouds, private clouds, and distributions with the new OpenStack Powered mark. This talk will give a practical overview of the interoperability efforts within the OpenStack community, and how to qualify your product for the OpenStack Powered trademark. It will include an overview of the requirements defined by DefCore and the OpenStack Foundation, best practices for testing products using RefStack, and what do to when you run into trouble. You will also learn how to best engage with the DefCore working group, Foundation Staff, and upstream developers in working to certify a product.

Push-button Deployment of Oracle Applications and Database with OpenStack Murano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditional enterprise software deployment can be complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.  OpenStack services provide a rich set of capabilities for automated deployment and configuration of raw compute, network, and storage, but have typically left the top of the stack to be managed by traditional configuration management (CM) tooling.  With OpenStack Murano's abstraction capabilities, deployment time can be reduced from weeks and days to hours and minutes, without the requirement to develop and maintain highly customized CM manifests.  Oracle is focused on enabling sophisticated enterprise applications from the OpenStack Murano Application Catalog with pre-configured, pre-tested templates.  In this session, Oracle experts will demonstrate how we have configured and deployed Oracle Database in our test environments using these templates and the Murano Application Catalog and how it can be incorporated into multi-tiered application stacks.

The Fall and Rise of Open Stack Cloud Appliances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are two trends effecting IT organization around Open Stack. The first is Open stack is evolving from it’s initial developer focus on “do-it-yourself” clouds to focusing on improving the operations and ROI of running Open Stack. The second trend is the rise of appliances (hyper-converged and converged infrastructures)  as a way IT and Business owners are consuming technology. Both trends are pushing for IT to provide faster services (provisioning, scaling, flash), self-service offerings, pushing against network, storage, virtualization/compute admin IT silos, and expecting dynamic on-demand scale at lower cost.

There are always alternatives! OpenStack as a component of a larger strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Very often OpenStack is viewed as the foundation and basis for a cloud strategy with the components that ship as part of the big tent often considered the only solution for some of the requirements and OpenStack as a platform getting rejected if one of these components doesn’t fit our needs. This should never be the case with a platform that is built on open API’s and extensibility. There are always alternatives!In this talk we look at how OpenStack exists a small piece of a much larger IT strategy and how existing enterprise tool sets can be integrated and drive the adoption and operational capability of an OpenStack cloud platform.

Turn-key OpenStack - improving economics and operations with a hosted model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Abstract While organizations everywhere gravitate towards OpenStack for their private clouds, taking talented engineers off of revenue generating activities is bad for business. Coupling that with an industry-wide OpenStack skill shortage along with capital constraints results in a classic outsourcing dilemma. The good news is that customers can now obtain private OpenStack deployments! QTS Data Centers and Canonical have teamed up to provide hosted private OpenStack clouds, custom-built to client technology specifications and OPEX budgets.  As a large scale data center and cloud provider, QTS hosts complex hybrid IT and cloud workloads, and works with open source software leader, Canonical, to deliver hosted OpenStack!

What Copel Telecom and I learned along the way to our first OpenStack cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Copel is the largest company in Brazil's wealthy Paraná state, and its telecommunications subsidiary, Copel Telecom, delivers a broad range of connectivity and hosted services to its enterprise and increasingly consumer customer base. Cloud was the one key product they were missing from their portfolio. This is the story of how their first cloud came into existence, and what they learnt along the way. Highlights include:    - What do you do when you have an even number of datacenters (but still want HA)    - Coming to terms with the fact that physical hosts (and their VMs) may temporarily (or more permanently) disappear    - What moving from the appliance world to software-defined storage actually implies    - How to handle the fact nobody on your team has any OpenStack experience and more.

Why OpenStack distributions exist?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many OpenStack success stories out there, and we often hear about how a team inside a company deployed OpenStack and manages it on a daily basis. In the early days, and still to a large extent today, these success stories were always about the team deploying OpenStack on its own. This however hides the fact that a huge number of deployment are nowadays using OpenStack distributions. This session will explore the many reasons why OpenStack distributions exist, and why they should be considered in the enterprise world. Ease of deployment, supportability, certifications, knowledge of the vendor, etc. are just some of the benefits that come with an OpenStack distribution and that should be considered when deciding upon a company strategy around OpenStack.

“Zero tickets” deployment of applications and infrastructure in the Enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the main drivers for Cloud adoption in the enterprise is the desire to improve the time to market of new features being delivered by application teams. Cloud aims to address this need by automating the many manual processes necessary to deploy code in a legacy environment. Unfortunately, all too many Cloud deployments fail to adequately address this need. In a recent Gartner study on the causes of failure of enterprise Cloud programs, 95% of respondents indicated that they faced significant issues with their private cloud deployment, and 31% of respondents attributed the cause to a failure to change the operational model. In many cases, enterprises attempt to shoehorn Cloud into their existing ticket driven workflows and find that while certain manual tasks are automated, the overall time to market is not significantly decreased, primarily due to the time spent waiting on tickets to be actioned or approved

Networking
----------


A General Network Virtualization Solution for Hybrid Virtualization Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In order to manage diverse workloads running on cloud infrastructure, it is very common to deploy hybrid virtualization platform in cloud resiliant data center and a typical scenario is to deploy VMware for traditional enterprise applications and KVM for cloud native applications. As a result, the capability of managing hybrid virtualization is necessary in OpenStack to meet the requirements, not only the management of computing resources but also the connectivity of heterogeneous network architectures. In China Telecom, we formed a joint research group with Pica8 and AWcloud in China to tackle this problem by open technologies, like SDN controller, whitebox switch and software-based virtual router, etc. The platform is deployed in our national cloud computing laboratory. This integrated solution provides Layer 2 connectivity, tunnel optimization, high performance routing, visibility and reliability. Finally, we would love to share the architecture and details to the community.

Accelerating Data Delivery to Containers via OpenStack and SmartNICs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Docker provides management of Linux containers with a high level API providing a lightweight solution that runs processes in isolation. It provides a way to automate software deployment in a secure and repeatable environment. When used with OpenStack it becomes much more powerful since it’s then possible to manage several hosts, which in turn manage hundreds or thousands of containers. NAT is often used in conjunction with Linux bridging and firewalling to securely connect containers to public networks. Offloading Linux bridging, iptables, and NAT to SmartNICs can increase the throughput and reduce the CPU utilization associated with network connectivity for containers. In order to support a large number of containers, demultiplexing to a commensurate number of host endpoints is required. This presentation explores these requirements in detail while describing options for high performance and accelerated implementations and the implications on OpenStack, specifically Nova and Neutron.

Advanced Network Services in OpenStack: Load-Balancing as a Service (LBaaS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This beginner session is about advanced network services in OpenStack, particularly focusing on Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS). In physical world of enterprise data centers, load balancers have evolved over time to do more than simple spraying of connections to a set of backend servers. We will delve into some of the core requirements including session persistence, SSL termination, and rule based switching. We will present the evolution of OpenStack LBaaS APIs as they incorporated these requirements. On the implementation side, we compare and contrast the most common architectures of LBaaS deployments: (i) process-based (reference architecture), (ii) appliance-based, and (iii) service-VM-based (Octavia's architecture). We will focus on service-VM architecture's elastic scalability and high availability. We will also share learnings from production deployments of elastic LBaaS in large-scale private and public OpenStack clouds.

Almost everything you need to know about provider networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Though the primary use case of OpenStack cloud is to create instances to tenant private networks and access them using floating IPs from external networks, there have been a lot of use cases to create instances directly to an external network to connect it to an existing network, especially for NFV. In this talk, you’ll get answers to the following questions and more: What are provider networks? What are the different types of provider networks (like flat and vlan) and what are their use cases? How do you configure provider networks to create instances directly to it and satisfy floating IP use cases? How do you enable access to Nova metadata service for cloud-init while instances are added to provider networks? How do instances communicate directly to external networks using provider networks? How do you troubleshoot problems related with provider networks?

Automatic network efficiency adjustment to optimize power saving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Energy - We all depend on it. But when it comes to your data center's scalability and operational expenses, we all try to reduce power consumption as much as possible. One of the biggest power consumers are the network elements. Network is a critical part of any cloud, but is it really working as efficient as possible? Especially when it comes to power efficiency?   In this talk we’ll describe a solution based on Watcher - a new OpenStack project that provides a flexible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds, and NEO: Mellanox Fabric orchestration and management tool. This solution enables to optimize network elements power consumption based on actual, real time cloud usage.

Automatic Underlay Management in Rack scale Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Often, you need to create networks like VLANs while the cloud is deployed and functional. Instead of logging on to the switch CLI, manually creating them and adding to Openstack Neutron for allocation, you would like an automated SDI solution. In a Rack Scale Design pooled infrastructure management infrastructure, automated network creation via newly published network service APIs in Redfish, from the central controller, effectively showcases composition of networks and network services. With a programmable switch and management APIs to discover neighbors, we present a scalable framework to manage underlay networks.

BaGPipe: BGP VPNs to implement Neutron virtual networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

BaGPipe is a proposition to implement Neutron virtual networking by leveraging the BGP VPN toolbox to distribute virtual networking states.BGP VPNs have been proven as a robust, scalable and flexible solution to create isolated virtual networks over IP/MPLS backbones, and have been extended to support various encapsulations (VXLAN, MPLS/UDP, ...), and support both IP and Ethernet virtual networks. The later becoming a mature solution for datacenter fabrics.We propose to reuse Neutron's existing framework for DB persistency and messaging, and reuse AMQP messaging to push to agent the more static configuration changes, thereby offloading the more chatty virtual network state updates from the message bus to the BGP control plane.This is an alternative way of delivering a rich feature set (e.g. BGPVPN interconnections, service-chaining), avoiding the addition of a full-blown SDN controllers and avoid the complexity of synchronising data between different persistency models.

Building Multi-Cluster LBaaS in Yahoo! JAPAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Our private cloud came to be composed of a number of OpenStack cluster, It is also often one of the web service is distributed across multiple OpenStack. LBaaS is strongly associated with its own OpenStack, can not manage the instance of other OpenStack cluster in LBaaS. You can add a member in OpenStack in the IP address, but the data of LBaaS had become apart. Therefore, we built dedicated OpenStack for LBaaS and aggregated all the LBaaS data for the OpenStack clusters. And transparently requests to Neutron of LBaaS OpenStack from Compute OpenStack. By this configuration, each of the Compute OpenStack will request to the dedicated LBaaS as if it's own Neutron. As a result, it is possible to aggregate the data for LBaaS to one OpenStack, it became easier operation.In this session, we will talk about the design and configuration of the new LBaaS used in Yahoo! JAPAN.

Challenges of DVR in a Large Scale Production Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) implementation provides the ability of each compute node to handle east-west / north-south traffic locally. For last couple of cycles, openstack community has spent a lot of effort on DVR to make it more robust and meet the industry needs.

Cliff's Notes for adding flavor support to L3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud operators deploying OpenStack today can only select a single monolithic L3 plugin. This presents a problem when attempting to virtualize infrastructure across multiple networking platforms: the cloud operator must either choose a plugin that supports a reference implementation (e.g. namespace routers, DVR, etc), or one that supports a vendor's implementation. A proposal to use the flavor-db framework to allow multiple drivers for L3 is a step towards addressing this limitation. This talk describes a framework in use for several releases with some of the same concepts proposed by the flavor-db L3 framework. It explains how the architecture enables multiple driver implementations, highlights some of the challenges and solutions for maintaining the L3 abstraction across a heterogeneous infrastructure, and demonstrates how benefits such as improved support and scaling can be realized by such a framework.

Connect all the things: span multiple clouds and networks securely in 30 seconds or less
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting VMs connected across different regions in the same cloud can be challenging.  Getting VMs connected between two different clouds is harder.  Migrating an active workload from one cloud provider to another is tougher still, and borders on impossible without deep networking expertise.  Much of the same connectivity concerns exist just getting connected to VMs in a cloud without giving them all public IPs or using a bastion host. There's a simple open source VPN designed to solve these problems (and more), with minimal experience required to make full use of it.This presentation will cover the background and technology enabling this VPN, showcase some real-world use cases (like moving your app from AWS to an Openstack cloud, or controlling a beer brewing system from your phone), and will include a LIVE DEMO deploying zerotier and using it on VMs distributed across multiple providers.

Container Networking Strategies in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For cloud architects looking to build secure networks that span several docker hosts in their OpenStack cloud, there are a bunch of different options available. One approach is to use the Kubernetes pod model. This involves creating pod CIDRs and privately accessible services that front-end the pods. You can then selectively expose some parts of your application to the external network by opening up the required ports to serve traffic. In this model, you are presented with a variety of networking options such as neutron overlay, flannel, calico, contiv etc. Another option is to use docker swarm with isolated docker networks created using the built-in overlay network driver. You could use a custom docker network driver plugin implemented as a remote-driver for LibNetwork, providing several additional features. Another approach is to use the capabilities provided by the OpenStack Magnum project. This talk will explore the variety of networking models available and demystify them.

Containers networking acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The use of Containers in OpenStack is growing, mostly around high performance work load such as NFV. While virtual machines networking stack evolved over time and offer many accelerations, Containers networking is significantly behind.  In this talk we'd like to present a proposal to enable network adapters stateless offloads such as: Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and Transmit Side Scaling (TSS) Accelerated Receive Flow Steering (RFS Dedicated HW descriptor ring and buffers for receive and transmit with containers. During the talk we'll show how we allow the above offloads to apply for Container networking through exposing them for vEth devices. This includes RSS/TSS and aRFS for steering packet processing to each Container associated cores and as well as assigning dedicated HW receive and send queue and buffers for each Container, resulting with enhanced network performance for Containers through standard existing administration tools

Contrail as networking soultion for OpenStack and Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Providing secure, high-performance, SLA-compliant cloud services to multiple tenants in multiple locations with hybrid cloud topologies is nearly impossible to do with OpenStack’s and Kubernetes default networking back-ends.Contrail can provide network micro-segmentation to kubernetes, with both network isolation as well as the ability to connect a pod to external networks interoperating existing network devices. Contrail SDN utilizes logical leaf-spine layout for added performance and resilience and BGP-based federation at the network edges for facilitating hybrid cloud connectivity. Bare-metal or VM-based deployments of Contrail lack the flexibility, portability and ease of scalability for hosts running SDN control plane components. On the other hand, containerized solutions provide huge benefits in cases of performance, scalability, portability and building microarchitectures.

Delivering Openstack NFV Service Chaining at Scale with Networking-SFC and Networking-OVN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The ability to dynamically create and modify service chains of multiple virtual network functions (VNF) is a critical component enabling the deployment of NFV. Until recently this ability has required add-on SDN controllers with third party neutron plugins, resulting in a patchwork of solutions. The Openstack networking-sfc has created a standard service chaining interface and an extensible driver model to enable different networking technologies to provide service chaining and flow classification. The networking-ovn project, which everages the OVN enhancements in OpenVSwitch, has introduced a new highly scalable networking infrastructure for Openstack. The combination of these Openstack projects will enable the delivery of advanced service chaining use cases.This presentation will show how advanced service chaining use cases can be delivered at scale by using these new Openstack components.

Deploying Group Based Policy to Secure Microservices Running in OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As microservices grow, traditional firewall rules based on network ACLs are no longer scalable and fall short of providing fine-grained enforcement. Group Based Policy (GBP) is a  flexible policy language that allows users to specify policy enforcement based on intent, independent of network infrastructure and IP addressing. Using micro-segmented virtual domains, administrators can define policies at a centralized location and use IO Visor technology for distributed enforcement. This provides infrastructure independent rules, template-based policy definitions, and scale-out policy enforcement for a solution that secures and scales with microservices.   The discussion will also cover using GBP for Cloud Foundry application spaces where microservices are deployed and need scalable, efficient security policies.

Deploying IPv6 in OpenStack Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

More and more enterprise and service provider environments are deploying IPv6 due to extreme IPv4 address exhaustion.  IPv6 support in OpenStack has come a long way but has had serious gaps until the recent releases.  Now, production quality IPv6 deployment within the tenant domain can be fully realized. This session will discuss: IPv6 deployment options for the cloud provider IPv6 address assignment options within the tenant space to include: SLAAC, Stateless DHCPv6 and Stateful DHCPv6 Using IPv6 Prefix Delegation to reduce the burden of IPv6 address management for tenants IPv6 with L3 HA Dealing with limitations in IPv6-only tenant environments Detailed slides as well as lively demos will be used throughout the session.   This session differentiates itself from other competing sessions because it focuses on proven designs and deployment guidance. It supports the growing need to operationalize OpenStack to support emerging use cases and it is presented in a lively way. :-)

Deploying IPv6 in OpenStack TripleO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol standard. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed IPv6 primarily as a means to combat the exhaustion of IP address from the current common IPv4 standard. But IPv6 has lots of new features and advantages compared to the older protocol. In the context of OpenStack, IPv6 features let users choose to spawn instances on IPv6 only or via dual-stack, and it lets architects decide if underlying services should run via legacy IPv4 or via the new IPv6. Not all features are currently implemented for IPv6, and users and administrators alike will face challenges in IPv6 enabled clouds. Throughout this session, administrators will learn how to deploy overcloud services and Neutron tenant networks in OpenStack.

Deploying Policy-based vTap on Virtual Ports, Service Function Chains, and VNFs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As virtual networks grow with complex VNFs and service function chains, monitoring and troubleshooting can become unwieldy without analyzing packet flows and traffic patterns to diagnose network issues. While first generation vTap offered port mirroring type functionality, policy-based vTap is extending the capability to perform more intelligent data gathering that are defined by classification and action rules on flows and reverse flows.  These rules can be applied at any point in a virtual network on virtual ports or any part of a service function chain including in between VNFs.

Distributed Hardware routing, along with neutron routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Routing has always been challenge in OpenStack. One solution does not fit all situations, hence, many routing choices - such as Neutron HA router, DVR, Astara, and HW routing.  How does one decide which is the optimal for their deployment?  Many factors play in such as - complexity of deployment (and debugability) as in DVR, or scale issues as in Neutron router.  So, what is critical? - Scale or ease of deployment? What if you can have both?  Well, come in and listen to our presentation, where we will discuss how we take hardware based distributed routing, along with neturon routers to make the deployment simpler and highly scalable.

Distributing OpenStack Networking Across Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scaling OpenStack in many cases involves operating multiple OpenStack regions or using Nova cells. One of the significant network challenges faced by operators is how to connect workloads in this distributed environment. This is also a challenge encountered when attempting to operate a hybrid cloud with a mix of on-premise and offsite resources. Deploying multiple OpenStack instances and connecting them together presents unique networking challenges. Floating IP's are a common and workable solution for connecting workloads in these environments. However, floating IP's can also be an inefficient way to connect workloads.In this session we will introduce a solution for connecting multiple OpenStack deployments using BGP EVPN. We will discuss how it integrates with features already available in neutron such as address scopes, DVR, and BGP dynamic routing. We will also discuss the current state of development of this solution and what functionality to expect in future releases.

DPDK accelerated OVS in OpenStack: How We Got Here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Recent versions of Open vSwitch (OVS) provide an accelerated datapath based on the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) libraries. The acceleration that DPDK provided is vital for meeting the high performance, high determinism requirements of NFV workloads. As the most widely deployed virtual switching in OpenStack, Open vSwitch (OVS) is a key vector in the race to enable real-time applications within OpenStack. Intel has been working with its partners since 2013 to bring the benefits of OVS with DPDK to OpenStack, and this work is finally bearing fruit. In this talk, we explore the work that has been done and the work that is still ongoing to bring the benefits of OVS-DPDK to OpenStack. We detail how users can benefit from these changes, and the impact they can expect to see. Finally, we detail how users can get started exploring these changes themselves, and how they can configure these solutions to deliver the maximum possible performance for their workloads.

DVR:  Ready for Prime Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Neutron DVR feature was first introduced in Juno to address the performance bottleneck created by the centralized L3 service, identified in early public cloud deployments of OpenStack. Since then, the Neutron community has steadily increased its functionality, scalability, and performance. DVR is now widely deployed in production customer cloud environments. This session will provide an overview of DVR's current production use cases, high availability characteristics, and network performance benefits. Experiences from real customer deployments will be highlighted. In addition, we will be providing a status update on the latest upstream developments surrounding L3 and DVR. This includes optimizations to enable NS routing for fixed or dynamically routed IP traffic, support for multi-hypervisor deployments, and hardware L2 Gateway and bare metal support. We'll leave plenty of time for audience questions, so come prepared!

Enabling advanced L7 Load Balancing in Kubernetes with OpenStack Kuryr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Load balancing is not the same in Kubernetes as in OpenStack. Kubernetes LB focuses on L4, especially for E-W traffic, with automatic backend management and affinity guarantees. OpenStack LB is comparatively more focused on N-S traffic, elasticity, and choice of different vendors for advanced capabilities. OpenStack LB also plays nice with L4 and L7 security, port mirroring, and QoS. Avi Networks and Midokura have combined the best of both approaches, leveraging OpenStack Kuryr and Neutron to implement overlay networking for Kubernetes This allows Midokura to automatically deploy and configure Avi Networks’ load-balancer Pods via LBaaS APIs, triggered by creation of Kubernetes Service templates and Pods. Avi Networks’ load balancer is a drop-in replacement for KubeProxy, preserving its advantages (affinity, no traffic trombones) while delivering high-performance SSL and real-time application monitoring. Kuryr programs security policies in Neutron based on Kubernetes templates.

Enabling AWS/Azure's VPN and DirectConnect/ExpressRoute in OpenStack - The missing pieces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Connecting openStack with your VPC in AWS or Microsoft Azure seems to become a common use case and a basic requirement. Other cloud platforms make it easy to do this end-to-end setup by just entering basic information and doing the setup themselves. What would it take for OpenStack to do that? Should OpenStack be doing more to help manage those integration points? Or maybe this should live in higher layers that abstract the cloud API and let one provision cloud resources in a platform-agnostic way using other tools. This talk will show Neutron’s BGP, VPNaaS and L2GW APIs can be used to automate private cloud connections in Hybrid clouds. We will then propose next steps to make these setups truly self-service and hassle-free.

Enabling Network Intents for OpenStack using Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As Neutron features evolve and become more complex, network intents can be specified by multiple stakeholders (e.g., tenants, operators), either directly via Neutron APIs or indirectly via HEAT templates. These individually specified intents may overlap/conflict, resulting in unexpected runtime behaviors. We demonstrate how to enable high-level network intents for managing diverse OpenStack services.  We present a system that defines a group of endpoints (EPG) using logical labels, with each label representing diverse endpoint attributes: e.g., application components they host, their locations, and tenants. We extract such labels and relationships using Congress and automatically construct a label namespace from metadata and database. This enables users to correctly define EPGs using the labels and allows our system to proactively/automatically compose these intents. Users can express complex intents as graphs to represent security/QoS. We also demonstrate our prototype on Newton.

Extending MPLS VPN network to Openstack.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a powerful cloud computing platform used to build public and private clouds. Enterprise and service provider operators are taking advantage of OpenStack to drive new business models. While most access to OpenStack workloads relies on the public Internet – there are times when private connections are needed. MPLS is a mature, well-understood transport technology in use today. Service providers who offer MPLS services may be interested in offering their own OpenStack platforms or connecting to other Openstack cloud providers. This type of inter-connectivity brings up questions. How do I connect MPLS VPNs to OpenStack projects? Can this connectivity be completely automated? What factors should I consider? This session will provide an example of how to develop automation to connect Openstack projects to service provider MPLS networks using REST APIs and NCS (Tail-F). The goal is to share an example and lessons learned so that participants may have a reference for future use.

Fast and Faster: OpenStack Security Groups using SmartNIC-Accelerated Connection Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack's security groups facilitate micro-segmentation of cloud infrastructure. Historically they have been implemented using the Linux bridging and firewalling facilities. The latest Open vSwitch release (2.5) can interface to the Linux kernel connection tracking (conntrack) module to improve the performance and granularity of security group implementations.  This presentation describes the OVS conntrack architecture and the expressiveness it offers. It covers the integration of OVS conntrack with OpenStack via an OVN driver or a ML2 plugin. It furthermore describes how OVS conntrack can be accelerated by employing SmartNICs, yielding improved throughput and reduced CPU utilization.

Fast and Flexible: Accelerated P4/C and Open vSwitch Datapaths for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Virtual switches are typically deployed in OpenStack managed cloud datacenter servers to act as overlay on/off-ramps, implement micro-segmentation (security groups) or otherwise process and forward packets. These virtual switches can implement the behavior required by an existing standard (for example Open vSwitch implements OpenFlow compliant switching), or implement the semantics directly expressed using a program (potentially written in a domain specific language like P4). A hybrid approach is also possible, whereby portions of the behavior conform to a standard, and other portions are implemented in modules expressed in P4 or C. This presentation compares these approaches, considering aspects like the expressiveness and performance of the resulting datapath as well how these datapath variants can be integrated into OpenStack. It furthermore considers the additional implications of accelerating the datapaths using SmartNICs, again considering the implications for OpenStack.

Firewall as a Service: Never Say Never Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) has experienced some rapid and extensive evolution in the Newton cycle.  A complete refactoring of the code joining FWaaS to the L3 agent, integration with the L2 agent, and the evolution of Neutron community standards have been significant challenges for the FWaaS team as implementation of the FWaaS v2 API spec has proceeded.  Hear from the FWaaS team about the challenges they have overcome, the current state of affairs, and the roadmap looking forward for Firewall as a Service.

Fits like LEGO: Building a cloud using Neutron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Neutron is like a Lego brick box for building, administering and monitoring virtual networks. Beginner users can easily understand Neutron’s basic building bricks, Port, Network and Subnet, to deploy a simple virtual network. However, when building a more complex private or public cloud, specialty bricks (e.g. router, floating-IP, security-groups, firewall) come into play. In my presentation, I will introduce the basic and specialty building bricks & how to use them to build five topologies: from a basic network topology all the way to the core block of multi-tenant self-service cloud. Each topology will be presented by its pros and cons, & how it fits other topologies in order to build an elaborated network structure.

Flexible SR-IOV Passthrough and VirtIO-relay Based Acceleration on an Open vSwitch Compute Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will demonstrate a setup merging SR-IOV passthrough, a virtio relay system and Open vSwitch offloading rules to an intelligent server adapter, or SmartNIC. This combines two separate technologies into one solution, providing performance and power savings not possible using a pure software Open vSwitch. Standard Open vSwitch requires extra processing on the hypervisor. SR-IOV passthrough on most NICs allow only simple flat networks and prevents VM live migration. Flow rules can be offloaded to a SmartNIC, saving processing cycles on the hypervisor and supporting complex network types. A virtio relay provides an efficient interface between an SR-IOV device using vhost-user, allowing VM live migration. OpenStack Nova and Neutron make a number of assumptions about SR-IOV and Open vSwitch based networking solutions. This session will demonstrate how, with a slight change in perspective, multiple networking solutions can be presented in a unified interface.

From Neutron to Neutron: SDN-driven backbone traffic engineering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Several models for providing end-to-end traffic engineering between data-centers in carrier backbone networks through the interworking of Data-center(DC) and WAN SDN Controller will be presented. The model will enable seamless end-to-end service and traffic engineering from host to host and/or ToR to ToR across large National Service Provider backbones. A number of use-cases including the dynamic provisioning of virtual resources in Data Center as well as logical resources in transport network will be covered.  Options such as DC SDN Controller to WAN SDN Controller coupling with abstract Interface definition or extension of an unified control plane which spans the Datacenter and Backbone Networks will be discussed along with advantages and disadvantages of the options. The direct sharing of information, via standardized information models, between SDN Controllers will result in improvements in efficiency, flexibility and improved elasticity of resources for modern Carrier Networks.

Give your compute nodes superpowers with layer 3 open networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack networking with multiple tenants can cause a complicated infrastructure. This presentation contains two parts: 1) Implementing an all layer 3 VXLAN network topology all the way to the compute nodes, and 2) Using this concept to design a network where traffic flows are clear to understand, debug, and troubleshoot. Combining these concept with standard Linux DevOps tools (like Ansible and Git) and other open protocols, one can create a more agile and easy to debug network with better automation.

How Did Our Private Cloud Realize Better Application SLA Using Open vSwitch with DPDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In recent years, our OpenStack private cloud resources (65k+ VM, 25k vCPU, 350TB memory) that support Yahoo! JAPAN web services require 6x network performance per server compared with traditional server farm as a result of VM aggregation and higher density.Additionally, huge and/or burst network traffic (5~10x than ordinary) we have often received from internet. More internal backend traffic (DNS, RDB, MQ, etc.) happend accordingly.In such situations, we faced a network performance issue in our cloud.To overcome this, we have adopted Open vSwitch with DPDK as a software L2 switch on HyperVisor instead of LinuxBridge, built new mitaka cluster (serving 8000+ VM scale) on OCP (Open Compute Project) servers, and started operation phase now.As we found many problems through our activities from OvS/DPDK PoC phase to operation phase, we will present about combination limitation related OvS/DPDK/NIC driver, network architecture/performance, L7 SLA, operation perspective, and future works.

How Scalable is OVN-powered OpenStack:  A Cloud Operator’s Perspective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Open Virtual Network (OVN) adds native support for virtual network abstractions. OVN is designed to be more scalable than the Neutron OVS implementation. As it reaches it's first release, work is underway to prove it's scalability in a large scale deployment. We present our methodology of building a CI/CD pipeline that helps OpenStack cloud operator to quickly identify performance and scalability bottlenecks in OVN, and to decide on the adoption of latest patches based on experimental results. Our solution deploys emulated compute nodes and real control plane setups, by containerization of OVN components, fake OVN chassis, and the rally-ovs extension. We will share the latest results from our experiments, as well as how these results help improve the overall scalability of OVN and OpenStack network functions powered by it. We also talk about how these results are enabling us to verify commits by integrating the work into the OVS/OVN continuous integration setup using travis-ci.

How software defined networking promises simplifying your life
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The demand for and consumption of Internet services and resources is growing. These are times in which software running on connected intelligent devices is replacing stand alone, single purpose hardware. Traditional networking is under the pressure from a new technology evolution: hardware can run faster but software can adapt faster. The networking data plane can be separated from the forwarding data plane and move to centralized, software-orientated configuration and datacenter management without relying on proprietary technologies. We know OpenStack is a popular cloud solution, but it is not the only solution out there and not all applications are prepared for running on an OpenStack infrastructure. To be able to offer integrated solutions, we need to use smart network technologies to interconnect those solutions. In large and hybrid data centers we need to be able to control and respond as fast as possible, with the minimum error percentage or exposition to the human factor.

Impact of DVR port-binding on Live Migration and Allowed-Address-Pairs in Neutron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  The Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) implementation in Neutron heavily depends on theNeutron port-binding to identify the DVR service ports to configure routers on hosts, and to route traffic both East-West and North-South. Some advanced features, such as Instance Live Migration and Allowed-Address-Pairs, have adirect impact on the distributed nature of the ports and how they are bound and unboundwith Floating IP addresses. This session will target the design considerations for Live Migration andAllowed-Address-Pairs with respect to DVRs, in order to achieve more flexibleuse cases by changing the relationship between Floating IPs and how they arebound and unbound to Neutron ports.

In-kernel Analytics and Tracing with eBPF for OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the movement of applications from bare metal to the cloud continues, considerations around analytics and tracing are becoming more prevalent for security, monitoring, and accounting. As an open source project under the Linux Foundation, the IO Visor Project is working with the kernel community on extending BPF (eBPF) and is being used by many companies for security, tracing, and analytics. This talk will describe how an OpenStack micro-segmentation framework using eBPF can be utilized for analytics and tracing to secure application workloads. Use cases around application security, intrusion detection using service insertion, identity will be described. While networking is one piece of the solution, sandboxing applications to avoid attacks is also important. We will also touch upon how eBPF technology and a unified policy framework can secure application workloads in areas beyond networking.

Integrating Containers with OpenStack Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This  talk examines how containers use the OpenStack networking in order to  be able to provide the containers with netwoking capabilities, and how  containers are different from VMs from a networking vantage point.  We  look at what the needs of container networks are, how those needs can be  achieved, and what trade-offs have to be made.  We will dive into some  specific container networking solutions, but the talk is primarily intended  to introduce people to the higher level techologies that container  networking uses, and what the future for container networking might  hold.  Only beginner-level  knowledge of networking will be assumed, and by the end of the talk you  should have a far better understanding of how OpenStack and container  networking works together.

Interconnecting Neutron and network operators' BGP VPNs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The networking-bgpvpn Neutron stadium project allows to create connectivity between Neutron Ports, via their Networks and Routers, to BGP/MPLS VPNs. These VPNs are a cornerstone of telecom operators' backbones and interconnect datacenters, businesses or NFV POPs. Interconnecting them on-demand with Openstack is a critical piece of the NFV and hybrid cloud puzzles. This needs to be done in a controller-agnostic fashion to let automation and orchestration code be free of ties to a specific solution. The networking-bgpvpn project has been kickstarted in the Neutron stadium in 2015 to address this need.

IP-Multicast in an Openstack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are you planning to use applications that use IP multicast in your OpenStack cloud – e.g IPTV? Are you planning to use high volumes of IP multicast? Are you planning to automate also the network resources required to run IP multicast from the viewpoint of an infrastructure provider? There is currently no multicast API available in OpenStack to declare resources needed by an application. As a result IP multicast runs only in L2 networks. But how to manage L3 multicast routing? High volumes of IP multicast can only be handled efficient if offloaded to the physical network infrastructure – but this offloading consumes a part of the hardware resources of the network equipment. This offloading needs to be controlled by the infrastructure provider. To do this, information is needed from tenants via an API. The goal of the talk is to collect enough interested parties to work on a blueprint for an OpenStack Multicast API, which covers L2, L3, cloud local and global network aspects.

IPv6 is Easy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Despite enjoying its 20th birthday in January, many engineers still find themselves intimidated by the apparent complexity of IPv6. Those that have tried often grew equally frustrated with vendor support leaving many deployments and business cases out in the cold. The good news is that light glimmers in the distance with worldwide user access to IPv6 climbing through 10% earlier this year. Services are attainable, applications (might) work and real users are connected. For the newly exposed, we will first cover the basics of IPv6, it's history, comparison to IPv4 and how it works. Those that are already familiar will enjoy a review of the changes made over the last decade. Does an RFC really require an entire /48 for each user and just how do you configure a DNS resolver anyway? Finally we will review the state of IPv6 support in major OpenStack components, what is coming in the future and ensure you are left with renewed energy to tackle your own IPv6 deployments with enthusiasm.

Is OpenStack Neutron production ready for large scale deployments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Neutron with ML2 OVS has always been a challenging component in terms of performance and scalability. However, in recent releases, several enhancements and bug-fixes have resulted in significant improvements in overall reliability, performance and scalability of Neutron. In this talk, we will share the results of our testing (both control-plane and data-plane) at large scale and provide a detailed data-driven analysis that explores the true scale limits and bottlenecks of Neutron. We also discuss better ways to tune Neutron configuration parameters for large scale. Moving forward, we expect further improvements based on planned optimizations. With these changes, is Neutron ready for large-scale production deployments? If customers are planning to deploy vanilla Neutron in their production deployments, what can they expect? How does the reference implementation stack up against other commercial alternatives? These are some of the questions the presentation tries to address.

Is the classic infrastructure policy approach future-ready for networking?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The classic approach to infrastructure policy is imperative associating a specific feature to a HW/SW component. This talk deabtes the viability of the classic approach and describes a declarative, capability-driven approach independent of a specific HW/SW component. The implementation of this approach is in progress in the OpenStack Nova scheduler [1]. The key benefits of this novel approach to the Nova administrator are simplified Nova Flavor policies and a future-proof path to managing a multi-vendor heterogeneous infrastructure [2] while preserving backward compatibility to the current imperative approach. Use cases discussed for this novel approach involve networking features like mirroring, overlays, service chaining etc. which are available through vSwitch, NIC or ToR.

L2 adjacency of KVM and Hyper-V cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are native applications (such as office 360) that needs to run on Microsoft supported Hypervisor platform for better efficiency. A windows shop will have majority of their production servers  running on Hyper-V platform, and their DevOps workload running on KVM cloud. Licensing and supportability implications of running Windows application servers on KVM hypervisor forces customer to deploy Hyper-V cloud along with the KVM cloud for their non- windows specific (such as Oracle database servers) application. Under such scenario, the VMs on KVM cloud cannot communicate to VMs on Hyper-V cloud over the secure VxLAN network.

L2 gateway in a production environment - highly scaled, secured, seamless data and control path .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It is heard that most of the cloud provider administrators find it difficult to configure openstack/networking-l2gw to bring legacy bare metal servers into cloud. This is because for the complete solution to work seamlessly, the administrator has to set the right configurations on the networking-l2gw side as well as on the switch side.

Layer 3 Tunnel Support for Open vSwitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Advanced OpenStack cloud networking use cases such as L3-VPN overlays or Service Function Chaining and the corresponding interwork with standard network equipment require SDN vSwitches to support an increasing number of tunneling encapsulations such as MPLS over GRE, VXLAN-GPE, Geneve, NSH, and others to carry any type of payload. Traditionally, the Open vSwitch (OVS) is the de-facto standard SDN vSwitch for OpenStack only supported L2 tunnels. Together with the OVS community we are enhancing OVS to support tunnels that can handle arbitrary payload types, including MPLS, IP or NSH.

Lessons learned enabling DPDK for an overlay-based SDN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

DPDK can offer many performance benefits, but inserting DPDK into an overlay-based SDN is non-trivial.Different SDN solutions have different constraints on integrations: design complexity, time, and cost restrictions are all part of the tradeoff matrix.Choices include selecting a proper adapting interface, and potentially using 3rd-party vendors, to address use cases where the open source DPDK integration is not sufficiently mature.We describe our experience integrating MidoNet with 6WIND, and show choices, tradeoffs, and final results obtained.Our goal is to extract and present generally applicable and useful lessons, for anyone planning a DPDK integration.

Make Network Great Again: Third Party SDN for Everyone and OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Networking has been rather dull since the 1980s, it has been limited by old technological decisions that have made it difficult to scale in terms of addressing fundamental changes in Cloud Computing models. Layer 2 and lack of Progammability along with semi automated, and manual configuration simply cannot make the Network perform the tasks that we require in 2016. OpenStack is now mainstream, and many Availability Zones sit along with new emerging deployments of Containers, Public Cloud Services and Progammable Restful APIs that abstract much of the Network in code. This session will detail how the Network can be made great again by leveraging a single API and framework to cater to everyones needs, across Silos and beyond the OpenStack Neutron services - making the network great agaiin for everyone.

Microservices vs Monoliths: How to make them communicate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot of enterprises are now managing multiple stacks of VMs and Containers in their Datacenters. Openstack is typically used as the orchestration tool for the VMs, but on the Container side multiple orchestration tools now exist: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos, and new ones every other day! The painful question is how do you provide a common networking framework for your containers and your VMs ? This talk is going to explore real deployment use-cases in which both VMs and Containers are involved, and how Networking was solved seamlessly as one single stack.

MidoNet Scalability Testing with Neutron in AWS to 1000 nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The flexibility of SDNs in contrast to traditional networks that are bounded to hardware restrictions is increasing the need to provide SDN scalability benchmarks such as the maximum number of hosts, routers, networks or virtual machines; what is the supported workload or the maximum flow setup rate. Although SDN is revolutionizing data center networks, its testing, benchmarking and monitoring at scale remains a major challenge which requires the tools capable of handling thousands of resources, such as ports or instances as well as the traffic between them. This talk presents the scalability tests done for MidoNet with OpenStack Neutron using open source tools in AWS. Using AWS and fleet spots instance we are able to launch more than 1K compute hosts for less that 100$ / hours. OpenStack Rally runs tasks for addressing scalability benchmark tests while monitoring different metrics such as virtual topology objects count with InfluxDB, Telegraf and Grafana.

Monitoring Network Underlays with BroadView Instrumentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

BroadView is an open source software suite that enables advanced analytics in next-generation networks. Troubleshooting network problems and ensuring application SLAs are very complex tasks. In cloud networks, overlay technologies reduce visibility into packet flows, thereby making it even more difficult to analyze issues and ensure SLAs. OpenStack projects such as Ceilometer and Monasca provide monitoring-as-a-service to deliver usage metrics from applications and tenant networks; however, underlay monitoring is not supported. Ensuring application SLAs requires overlay mapping to the underlay, and optimal performance of underlay infrastructure is essential. BroadView-based solutions enable programmable access to underlay monitoring, facilitating applications to gather advanced analytics in a highly scalable manner. This session explains how BroadView with Monasca provides network administrators a single pane of glass to monitor all aspects of the network.

Multi-site Neutron federation using OpenDaylight with direct host to host cross site connectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Multi-site OpenStack proposals to-date require network gateways to connect the sites weather L2 Gateway or VPN. In the presented solution for multi-site neutron federation inter site connectivity is achieved by allowing direct tunneled connectivity between compute hosts on different sites eliminating the Gateway bottleneck.This solution is based on federated OpenDaylight (ODL) controllers acting as the Neutron driver in all sites. Each site has an independent local ODL cluster and the clusters communicate with each other using a distributed mapping service. By leveraging OpenFlow and OVS-DPDK 100Gb L2 and L3 networking performance is achieved even across sites. Sites may be geographically remote or partitions on a single data center.Cross site network models are defined by a cross site manager which communicates over standard Neutron API with the Neutron service instances in different sites.The entire solution demonstrated is an open source implementation upstreamed in the ODL project

NetArbiter: Multi-site Network Stitching and Emulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC), distributed storage systems such as Ceph can be deployed over multiple sites to improve reliability and latency.  In order to deploy and test distributed storage systems in a geographically-dispersed cloud environment, we have built a framework for multi-site network stitching and emulation called NetArbiter. NetArbiter is able to bind different OpenStack clusters such that Virtual Machines (VMs) communicate with each other within a single private network domain. In addition, NetArbiter can emulate network delay and bandwidth between geographically distributed sites.  NetArbiter uses a DevOps tool named Ansible for ease of implementation and deployment.

Network Dataplane Acceleration Techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Increasing load on the network often comes at a high cost: having kernel process a lot of packets in a unit of time leads to significant increase in CPU utilization and performance degradation. Using  overlay networks (eg. VxLAN) where encapsulation/decapsulation takes place makes the situation even worse.   Modern hardware allows to take some load from CPU and distribute part of the network processing to the NIC. There are also software techniques that can be used in conjunction with hardware ones to improve throughput greatly.   In this talk we will demonstrate the effect various acceleration techniques  have on performance. We examine differences in throughput as well as the effect on CPU utilization when these techniques are used. In particular, we will touch the following technology areas: Usage of hardware offloads SR-IOV acceleration techniques Software-based acceleration with DPDK

Network of the Future: Accelerated OpenStack Networking with Contrail vRouter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenContrail system enables OpenStack to support virtual networks that span across datacenters, using a vRouter software dataplane component. However, running the dataplane purely within the hypervisor can have a significant CPU and memory bandwidth cost. We describe how a programmable NIC (SmartNIC) can accelerate the dataplane by offloading the routing function and directly delivering traffic into and out of VMs. With the concept of “representative interfaces” and a vendor-neutral offload API, the presence of hardware acceleration can be almost transparent to the orchestration and management layers.This new approach requires OpenStack to treat VM and hardware interfaces differently from those of traditional NICs. We examine the tradeoffs of various acceleration architectures, and the implications of SmartNICs to OpenStack architecture. The resulting system offers the flexibility of software while improving on the resource usage and performance of traditional hardware.

Network Orchestration for the Enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network virtualization is now becoming a standard practice in many data centers. The reality though is that many organization still rely on manual processes to manage their network infrastructure, since achieving reliable and scalable network automation, while ensuring carrier-grade considerations such as security, standards, and robustness is no simple feat. In this session, we will discuss how we can automate network operations through Openstack Neutron together with the rest of the application stack. We will also discuss how we can use network automation to actually increase network security, all while ensuring enterprise-grade standards are maintained.

Network Policy Enforcement Based on Cloud Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session we will introduce current segmentation technologies, highlight their limitations and show what would be required to tackle these. Current segmentation technologies have not been designed to be used in highly scalable, dynamic and on-demand environments such as cloud deployments. Also, current segmentation technologies do not provide the means to classify and isolate traffic based on cloud entities. Networks rely on identification approaches (IPs, port numbers, etc.) to apply policies, define forwarding decision, etc. Without cloud provider, service and tenant visbility on the network layer it is impossible to enforce fine-grained policies. In this session we will highlight a novel approach that takles current limitations, introduces Cloud specific identifiers and enables a multitude of critical use-cases and applications.

Network Trunking in OpenStack Neutron: Architecture and Design Challenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Typically a Neutron port maps to a virtual interface as presented by hypervisors to a virtual instance, or bare metal instance in physical infrastructures. This clearly limits the amount of Neutron networks that an instance can access at any given time. The Neutron trunk feature overcomes this limitation by allowing OpenStack instances to access hundreds or thousands of Neutron networks from a single Neutron port. In this session you will learn about the proposed API, the architecture and challenges faced during the development of this feature in relation to the Open vSwitch and the Linux Bridge implementations available in Neutron.

Network-diagnoser: A Distributed Health Monitor For Multi-tenant Network in DVR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nowadays, Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) becomes more and more popular in overlay network deployment. With DVR, we can isolate the failure domain of network node and optimize network traffic by eliminating the centralized L3 agents. However, as its complicated implementation,  it is literally difficult to identify the root causes of faults on failure. Though there are various network monitoring frameworks for OpenStack, most of them don't work well with DVR mode. Network-diagnoser is a project for automatic network monitoring, troubleshooting and visualization, which makes it easy and efficient to resolve multi-tenant network issues, especially for DVR mode. It conisits of a centralized controller and several distributed agents. Network-diagnoser has been deployed in Qihoo production cloud and working steadily. It really makes our lives easiser.

Networking approaches in a container world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Networking has always been a complicated and delicate topic. It is even more complicated in the world of containers, where huge numbers of containers are continuously created and respawned across entire data centers. There are several container networking choices available, each one with a different implementation and its own peculiarities. The different approaches taken by the different vendors to solve the container networking question can make it daunting to picking the right one for your environment. This talk reviews how the major Linux Container networking solutions work: their implementation details, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they influence the deployment of distributed applications in both container only environments and mixed VM - Container environments.

Neutron at CERN: moving thousands of production nodes from Nova Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

CERN has been running a production OpenStack Cloud for several years. It was based on Nova Network from the start, with a few changes on the upstream code to adapt to the specifics of our internal networking infrastructure. With more than 6000 hypervisors split in tens of cells, 20000 virtual machines and an heterogeneous setup (KVM and HyperV) moving to Neutron with minimal disruption to users posed a significant challenge. In this talk we'll describe the Neutron plugin we wrote to integrate with our infrastructure, and additional extensions added to take into account network partitions (now covered with the upcoming segments feature being added upstream). We'll cover how we deployed Neutron and how we first enabled it in new cells, and later migrated existing cells once we were confident with the setup and sure it would scale. Finally we'll cover the new features we're looking into or have already enabled, such as Floating IPs, LBaaS and others.

No more Network Node : "OpenSON" Fully SDN-based OpenStack Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we present OpenSON (Open Softwarized Networking Platform), a fully SDN-based networking solution, which implements OpenStack networking on virtual switches in compute nodes without a network node. Network functions such as DHCP, SNAT, DNAT and L3 routing are typically executed on a network node in a traditional OpenStack environment. OpenSON, however, eliminates the dependency on the network node by implementing those functions as distributed flow rules on virtual switches in the compute nodes hosting relevant virtual machines. As a result, this approach supports better L3 scalability and high availability.Moreover, the SDN-based networking approach enables to integrate the control of both overlay networks for virtual networking and underlying physical networks, which enhances the network visibility and facilitates the introduction of network applications such as network monitoring.

Octavia Load Balancer as the last line of your cloud application defense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk is about turning on HTTPs handling in Octavia, the Open-Stack Load-Balancing as a Service. Octavia's Load-Balancer nodes can terminate the HTTPs connections at the Load-Balancer tier. It can improve your service performance by off-loading the TLS work from your back-end servers. It is required if you want to apply Octavia's L7 Load-balancing rules while using HTTPs. Cool!, so WHAT ARE THE ISSUES? (Q1) How much load is cause by TLS stuff? Answer: It depends.... but it may be significant (Q2) Can the Load-Balancer handle it? Answer: Usually not! -- you need ACTIVE-ACTIVE (Q3) Is it secure? Answer: Yes, but read the fine print... Follow-up questions: With Active-Active turned on several Load-Balancer nodes can handle the TLS load, but there is a new piece to the puzzle -- the Distributor. (Q4) Can the Distributor handle the load? Answer: Yes! (Q5) Is the Distributor secure? Answer: Yes, but read the fine print...

ODL/OpenContrail Integration with OpenStack, the Pain the Gain and the lessons learnt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack without SDN Controller is like life without Tapas (You would understand if you’ve been to Barcelona). In the dreamland everything works seamlessly. You want ODL to sing with your OpenStack or you would like to see OpenContrail dance with it, your choice, it will just work. But, you have to take up the daunting journey of “integration”, which is not as pleasant and straight forward as one might think. In this presentation, we’ll detail steps to integrate SDN Controller with your OpenStack, what are challenges and how we solved them. Join us to learn how and what to do and more importantly, what not to do. Ask us your questions, share your comments and let us help share the story of our journey with those who are undertaking it now to make it easier for them what was a rather an “interesting” experience. Leave the session on a high note of believing that we’ll make your OpenStack sing and dance with your choice of SDN Controller (ODL or OpenContrail).

OpenStack At Hyperscale: Deploying On a Full-Mesh Routed Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation will cover Clos networking architecture, also known as "Spine and Leaf", and presents an overview of deploying OpenStack in a fully routed network architecture. By utilizing the routing features present in most top-of-rack datacenter Ethernet switches, spine-and-leaf isolates broadcast domains and allows for horizontal scalability. Deploying OpenStack in a routed network environment requires knowledge of how OpenStack interacts with the network, and careful planning to ensure interoperability of components across routed subnets. Hyperscale architecture expands spine-and-leaf with a multi-dimensional spine. Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn use hyperscale architecture to maximize their capacity and throughput. While Hyperscale architecture is new to most Enterprise networks, the concepts behind spine-and-leaf networking are well established, and the technologies used are the same that you will find in any carrier-grade Internet service provider network.

OpenStack in production:  the challenge of SDN and lifecycle management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running a production OpenStack cloud starts with a successful deployment, but the real challenges begin after you go live.  Integrating third party SDN solutions and software into an OpenStack cloud adds another layer of complexity to the environment.  One of the most vexing issues is ensuring that configurations are maintained across upgrades and updates of individual components.  Lifecycle management is a key requirement for a robust OpenStack deployment, enabling an operator to customize and maintain highly tailored environments.  During this session we will go through a few real-life examples of the approach we’ve taken with some of our most complex SDN use cases, including lessons learned and best practices.

OpenStack Neutron: Deep dive into practical cloud networking with BigSwitch BCF and OpenVswitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The talk takes a deep dive into two SDN solutions for OpenStack: BigSwitch BCF P+V Edition and native Neutron with DVR. For each of the solutions, it uncovers the internals of the implementation of the virtualized networking. It explains in great detail the flow of packets between virtual instance and between virtual instances and devices on external provider networks. It demonstrates practical approaches and methodology for tracing flows in virtualized networks. Even though the examples are based on Native Neutron and BigSwitch BCF P+V, the approaches are applicable to any other SDN solitions. Understanding the ins outs of the implementation of virtualized networks is the only way to effectively analyze, evaluate and troubleshoot SDN solutions. This presentation has been given multiple times to internal teams within in my organization and has often been refered to as an "eye openner".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack in Production is now mainstream, with 60%+ adoption of OVS (openvswitch) as the de rigueur solution for Clouds running Neutron and Network services (Provider Networks), we have now a higher demand for actually mantaining the virtual switch and Linux stack in proper fashion. It's clear that Operators need the right tooling to isolate and troubleshoot issues, such as flows between Nova Compute Nodes and VMs, finding tap interfaces and virutal etherports and also simply being able to debug information and find relevant material in the community. The challenge is that the Linux Networking stack is complicated and tooling varies from simple command line (tcpdump)to more sophisticated projects such as SkyDive / PlotNetCfg and a myriad of third party SDN tooling. This session will be a refresher on what is out there and what can make life easier for operators and sharing the tool with the #openstack-operators and sharing on https://github.com/osops.

OSIC Enables the SDN Sale: Testing MidoNet with Neutron at Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We know that adoption of OpenStack and SDN has lagged expectations. This is in part due to the lack of SLAs and performance benchmarks demanded by large customers. Developing these benchmarks requires access to large-scale clusters - not easily available to the community or to startups.   The OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) solves this problem by providing OpenStack vendors with access to large datacenters to stimulate the generation of performance, scalability and reliability results necessary for SDN selling.   We present our experience testing open-source MidoNet networking virtualization with OpenStack Neutron at scale (132 servers) in the OSIC lab. We discuss: Implementation details of the physical deployment and virtual topology The rationale behind our choice of tests Benchmarks obtained Finally, we summarize the results for network performance and the strengths of MidoNet as a network virtualization solution, especially its resilience against failovers.

Performance Analysis of Openstack Infrastructure using Collectd and Grafana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Understanding the performance of a cloud is a challenging task. That too with complex clouds like openstack, running myriad number of processes across a cluster of systems, is more complicated. In such situation, understanding the performance of each system, storage and network of openstack while optimizing them together would be a great option. A single user friendly customizable dashboard showing all the metrics would be very enticing for a cloud architect/operator. Extracting every bit of performance from the openstack cloud makes a lot of sense before any system upgrades are initiated. In this presentation and demo we focus on evaluating the performance of OpenStack infrastructure using open source tools like collectd and Grafana on a Dell cloud test-bed. Collectd and Grafana can be considered as the Swiss army knives of monitoring tools. Session aims to interactively explore the dashboard and the performance metrics produced by the openstack infrastructure using these tools.

Physical bug fix in a logical world: an approach to network root cause analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud computing introduces a host of new troubleshooting challenges for the operator:Poor performance might stem from one of many unrelated issues, from CPU utilization to network congestion to physical network errors.Problems can be intermittent - there for your users, but not by the time you lookTracking problems from the virtual network env. to the physical network is very tricky.Whether private or public cloud, the need for rapid network fix is the same - get it done now! Yet the added complexity, moving parts and layers of an SDN greatly complicate the root cause analysis and bug fix. In this session we first outline the existing challenges faced by network operators in a cloud env. We then elaborate on the abilities built into MidoNet for solving some of the challenges. These new capabilities are supported by the Cumulus Linux platform and Broadcom Broadview, although in principle MidoNet tools work on any platform that provides the necessary information and interfaces

Resolving the SR-IOV conundrum for NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

If you deploy an openstack based NFV solution, you have to make a fundamental trade-off right off the bat -- you can either use a hypervisor/virtual switch based networking for VMs or you can use SR-IOV. A virtual switch based solution gives us all the “SDx goodness” that openstack promises (like self service, network virtualization, advanced traffic steering, distributed firewall/security, policy enforcement, etc) at the cost of additional processing on the hypervisor, OR you can use an SR-IOV based VM network that can achieve faster network function performance by doing a direct DMA to/from the NIC to the VM at the cost of sacrificing that “SDx goodness”. In this talk, we will show how this issue can be resolved cleanly by a modern SDN fabric. By moving the user intent to a policy framework that can be enforced directly in hardware, we can allow the hypervisors to give direct DMA access for network traffic without losing any flexibility provided by the SDx APIs/interfaces.

Scale-out virtual machine bandwidth using Neutron DVR and OSPF deployed using Docker containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Current neutron DVR implementation depends on L2 connected public networks which will cause scalability and performance issues when you want to support multiple racks. In this talk, we will dive into a L3 based DVR implementation. We will see how using pure L3 DVR implementation helps achieve higher scalability and programmability Neutron DVR. By using this scale-out L3 implementation, bandwidth is now on the order of the number of hypervisor nodes and only bound by the limitations of the physical network itself.

Scaling Neutron Networks to Ten Thousand Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the increasing adoption of Neutron networking in production environments, cloud operators have greater expectations for the number of ports supported by a Neutron network. This problem is further compounded by projects such as Magnum and Kuryr that bring container orchestration and networking to Neutron users. Supporting this scale is challenging and puts significant pressure on the SDN controllers and their southbound database. The difficulty lies not only the actual number of ports but also the expected churn from short-lived containers. While a distributed controller mitigates some this pressure, the southbound DB is still a bottleneck in most cases. With the goal of making a ten thousand port network a reality, in this session we address the scalability problem from two dimensions. First is scalability in the virtual plane, by designing southbound models that allow loading the ports based on demand. Second, we tackle the physical plane by scaling across many physical hosts.

Scaling Up OpenStack Networking with Routed Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, we will introduce Neutron's Routed Networks functionality which was added during the Newton cycle. Routed Networks rely on a layer 3 architecture that routes traffic to small segments of the network to achieve scale. This approach serves well deployments where large scale is a paramount requirement and users just need a set of VMs with IP addresses. Routed Networks showcases how technology can be simplified and scaled, two goals that are often difficult to meet together. We hope to inspire architectural decisions that eliminate unnecessary complexity and complicated user experiences. This presentation will include a live demo.

Scheduled to be the Fittest: Network-aware Scheduling in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

More and more cloud applications, especially virtualized network functions for NFV, or HPC applications, depend on the network features and capabilities that servers can provide to run optimally. For example, certain applications may need the underlying servers to have a high link speed (40GbE), network HA (MLAG) support, or a server where the switch uplink is not congested. In this session, we are going to present a way to schedule the VM based on network awareness, so that the VM can be the fittest to applications’ networking needs. Specifically, the proposal is to add a “Network-Aware Filter” to Nova scheduler, i.e. an External agent (“Network Aware Cloud Scheduler Agent”), that exposes REST APIs for the management of resource pools/Inventory. In this manner, a user can then choose to filter or grade hypervisors according to these attributes (similar to CPU. Memory, etc.). This work was motivated by the resource providers specs driven by the NOVA core community.

Security group performance improvement with ipset for multi-region environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation explains security group in multi-region environment: why it is needed, what is a problem, and how resolve it.'Region' is one of methods to separate OpenStack environment for redundancy. Each region is independent OpenStack environment except keystone. To use multi-region environment for backup or disaster recovery, VM instances in each region need to communicate each other to share their data. Therefore security group to allow the communication between regions have to be set up.However there is a critical performance problem when setting up security group across region, because to allow connection between regions, we have to add rules using remote_ip_prefix and specify IP address of each instances one by one. The number of iptable rules are increased and it causes performance degradation of network.To resolve this problem, I propose to optimize iptable rules using ipset in L2 agent so that a bunch of iptable rules can coalesce into one group.

Service Function Chaining (SFC) with Neutron, CNI and CNM based VNFs using OpenContrail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Based on the type of virtualization different networking frameworks are used.OpenStack networking is based on Neutron, Docker uses the Container Networking Model (CNM)and Kubernetes, OpenShift and Mesos can use the Container Network Interface (CNI).The common denominator of the three frameworks is a plugin system for externalSoftware Defined Networking (SDN) drivers.In this session we will talk about the OpenContrail SDN controller providing drivers forall three frameworks. As part of the session we will demonstrate how the orchestration toolsand command line interfaces of the frameworks can be used to create Virtual Networks (VNs) andto interconnect Virtual Machines and Containers. We will show that VNs created with oneframework can be consumed by another framework. To show the full potential of the solutionwe will setup a Service Function Chain (SFC) with three Virtual Network Functions, each based on oneof the three frameworks and distributed across multiple hosts.

Sharing Your Driveway With Neighbours The OpenStack Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides many technologies to ensure your applications are protected from noisy neighbours using all their CPU.  We explore how to achieve the same thing for networking. This talk will explore partitioning network resources with OpenStack and how it complements the significant progress that is being made on partitioning compute resources with Enhanced Platform Awareness. The following will be covered: How to run applications to get dedicated compute resources The current state-of-art on network scheduling and bandwidth management from a tenant perspective Where this needs to go to provide dedicated network resources How both the compute and network infrastructure contribute to the solution space How fabric management is a necessary component of a cohesive solution We will report on our experiments to date, and identify areas where we can extend OpenStack to better address network isolation.

Speed and Reliability: How to Achieve both for OpenStack Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV) enables cloud applications direct access to the server’s I/O hardware to achieve maximum network performance and efficiency. It does so through PCIe extension to virtualize a Physical Function (PF) into multiple Virtual Functions (VF). While OpenStack does support SR-IOV ports, there is no easy way to support VF high availability because it gives no control to user on how VFs will be distributed across PFs. In this presentation, we will introduce a way to achieve network high availability by exposing multiple VFs inside a guest, and utilizing them in various ways to achieve VF protection and failure recovery. For example, one way is bonding the VFs. Having multiple VFs/PFs does not protect the guest from switch failure. Two PFs can be connected to the same switch. Thus, we introduce a way to indicate the need to allocate VFs from PFs that are connected to different switches (thus partially circumventing the Shared Risk Link Group phenomenon).

Stateful Service Meets Stateless Gateway: Resolve Bottlenecks to Horizontally Scale L3 Gateways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Stateless layer 3 gateways appear to be a simple way to increase scalability and on-ramp traffic to your virtual network. Growing throughput requirements can easily be met with additional gateway nodes. However, the apparent simplicity of L3 gateways scaling breaks down with the addition of stateful L4 functionality, such as NAT or load balancing, when the gateways quickly become a bottleneck. In this session, we present how we identified, debugged and ultimately solved this problem. To this end, we borrowed from the design of Google Maglev and built on top of the high performance foundation offered by Cisco's Vector Packet Processing (VPP) for DPDK. During the session, we demonstrate this functionality built on top of open-source MidoNet, although the same solution can be transposed to alternative SDNs.

Subnet Service Types - Addressing the Public IP Address consumption problem with Neutron routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In Neutron, each router with an interface on the external network consumesan IP address from the subnet configured on it. These IP addresses aretypically Internet-routable, and in most deployments are a scarceresource. When running with Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR) enabled,additional IP allocations are done for each compute node, which canquickly increase the number of addresses required into the thousands. A new concept is being introduced in Neutron to allow a subnet to belabelled with a "service type", such that IP allocations for routerports can use subnets that do not contain Internet-routable addresses,leading to a substantial decrease in usage. In this session we will describe what a Subnet Service Type is, howthey can be used in a large-scale deployment to reduce Public IP Addressconsumption, and do a short demo on the new commands and usage.

Survey of Security Group Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, we'll examine the behavior of four different Neutron security group configurations, so we can better understand their common behavior and where they differ. We'll examine the existing IPTables firewall driver in the Open vSwitch (OVS) and LinuxBridge contexts. We'll also look at the new OVS Firewall Driver and the firewall functionality in Open Virtual Network (OVN). All firewall drivers are responsible for anti-spoofing protection, so we also look at the behavior of the allowed-address pairs extension in each of these contexts.

Tenant Networks vs. Provider Networks in the Private Cloud Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Neutron defines two major types of networks- tenant networks and provider networks. OpenStack administrators must decide what their Neutron network deployment strategy will leverage- tenant networks, provider networks or some combination of the two. This session will describe the unique challenges presented by tenant networks in the private cloud context and will build an argument for why shared provider networks may provide the best Neutron network deployment strategy for enterprise private clouds. This session will also discuss the rationale behind the assertion that network security is now orthogonal to network topology (which if true, is a significant factor leading to the viability of shared provider networks).

The battle of the switches: Neutron with Open vSwitch versus Linux Bridge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge are two competing open source backends for OpenStack Neutron. While OVS is popular among both developers and users as shown in the latest OpenStack User Survey report, some operators have prior knowledge of Linux Bridge and are looking for a simple solution. In this session we would like to explore the two backends and try to address the key question: Which one’s for you? We will try to make it as objective as possible and stick to the facts - Which use cases are covered, where do features end up, who performs better, how big are the Neutron and Linux communities behind them, how does CI and test coverage look like, does the community push for a default via documentation and more. Objective facts aside, after years of direct contact with Red Hat’s customers and the OpenStack Neutron development community, we’ve formed a strong opinion and we won’t be afraid to share it.

The evolution of OpenDaylight with OpenStack: big changes for production environment in future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenDaylight is an open source SDN(Software Defined Networking) platform which provides various features. One of the biggest use-case is OpenStack integration as network virtualization. So the OpenDaylight community has spent much effort on this use case along side with neutron community. In OpenStack netwon cycle and OpenDaylight Boron cycle, we've made big progress and changes. In OpenStack side migration to new driver framework for HA, in OpenDaylight side migration to new code base, VPNService from the old netvirt. Those are the essential and big change necessary for production  environment. Those changes come with new features, L2Gateway, ACL for security groups, SNAT, QoS, SFC and etc.Since they are all internal changes, it shouldn't affect user facing features ideally, but the real world is not perfect. The implementation changes, pitfalls and things to be aware of will be discussed. This session will be concluded with the future plan.

The Fuel VMware DVS plugin in comparison to other networking VMware backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many OpenStack users want to build hybrid clouds with both KVM and EXSi hypervisors -- and they must communicate with each other. The abundance of solutions for networking VMware backends can be confusing, so we will compare the Networking vSphere (VMware DVS) driver with others to provide enough information to make the right choice. This session covers: An overview of existing solutions, including: Nova-network Networking vSphere (OVSvApp) NSXv The Fuel plugin for VMware DVS The Networking vSphere (VMware DVS) driver A Demo of a deployed VMware DVS environment  Limitations, known issues and areas for future work The low latency, higher performing Networking vSphere (VMware DVS) solution, deployable with Fuel, is interesting for mid- and large size enterprises and telcos who are looking for an appropriate solution for their networking requests in vSphere-based or hybrid clouds as well as developers who are working on such solutions.

The good, bad, and ugly about Neutron Distributed Virtual Routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron networking has traditionally offered limited scalability by routing all network requests through a dedicated network node.  With the arrival of DVR capability as part of Neutron, the ability to scale Openstack has now changed.  Out of the box, Neutron offers DVR as another option to scale Neutron networking while deploying Open vSwitch.   In our presentation, we discuss the change in architectural designs, how people can benefit from the change in Neutron, and a walk-through on how we can enable components in your OpenStack cloud to utilize these features without buying additional hardware.

The race conditions of Neutron L3 HA's scheduler under scale performace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron's Router presents a L3 interface that connects VMs to an external network. In its legacy mode, a router can be scheduled only to one agent at a time, presenting a single point of failure - if that node fails, all communications are halted. L3 HA mitigates this issue by presenting an Active/Passive configuration where a router can be scheduled to multiple agents which recover the datapath automatically during failures using a dedicated network that hosts keepalived processes. Using L3 HA presents an orchestration problem: since a router now appears in more than one agent and another dedicated network is required for the keepalived processes, there are a lot more resources involved. We performed L3 HA scale testing for Liberty and Mitaka, which showed benefits of L3 HA and uncovered a number of race conditions in Neutron code both on L3 agent and on server side. We'll present results of this scale testing and showcase some of these race conditions.

Traffic Visibility with Virtual TAP and physical Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As core businesses moving to cloud continually, flow visibility is becoming more and more important. It is the foundation for network traffic monitor, trouble-shooting and security analytics. Now, there are some tools to steer traffic in community such as mirror, sflow/netflow, tap-as-a-service. However, these tools have some limitation (e.g, performance, deployment restriction).   Elastic Tap is a distributed, multi-tenant traffic probe that is deployed in vSwitch. It steers virtual traffic to off-the-shelf devices, where analytics is done. Elastic Tap has less negative performance impact on the switch because it is based on configurable policy. This presentation will discuss this Elastic Tap in detail.

Trunked 40G Interfaces with QoS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Usually, OpenStack network architecture is complex and costly. Using multiple 10GbE NICs and Switches for management, storage, internal and public… will be a headache for the operators.   In the past, our private openstack deployment used many 10GbE interfaces with 2-link bonding. As a result, we had to manage 8 links!   This year, we introduced 40GbE NIC to simplify the situation, and we found this can reduce initial costs and everyday maintenance costs.   In this presentation, we will show: How to reduce many 10GbE links to trunked and 2-link bonded 40GbE NIC How to use Quality of Services (QoS) features to ensure bandwidth of each logical links when introducing 40GbE NIC.

Under the Trenchcoat: Neutron Agent Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron agents are a critical part of the Openstack networking infrastructure. The Quality of Service (QoS) effort leading up to Liberty prompted the creation of an L2 agent extension mechanism in order to provide a defined ability for agent extensions to be added to the neutron-openvswitch-agent. Other Neutron L2 agents, such as neutron-linuxbridge-agent and neutron-sriov-agent, have since been modified to utilize this extension mechanism. In the Newton cycle, this framework was generalized and implemented in Neutron's L3 base agent, with FWaaS' v2 implementation as the initial subscriber. This talk will discuss: The history of agent extensions in Neutron. A deep dive into how they function. Various use cases that take advantage of them. We will review a selection of the current use cases for agent extensions. Finally we will examine future use cases and development trends for Neutron agent extensions.

Unified networking for VMs and containers for Openstack and k8s using Calico and OVS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Mixing containers and VMs in one environment is difficult. Ongoing progress in containerization of services should be confronted with legacy use-case of enterprise workloads. It should be possible to stay opened to 'old-style' solutions and in the same time support latest trends in microservicing. The talk will present possible future of datacenter networking platform based on containerized Openstack environment run on Kubernetes cluster. The presentation will show architecture of co-located containers and VMs joined in common networking framework. To enable this, Neutron, Calico and OVS technologies will be explored. We will show how they can be configured to support unified networking. The evaluation of solutions existing on market will lead to assessment of current value and will show needed improvements to achieve common use-cases in both containers and VMs worlds. The requirements to fulfill are HA, multitenancy and exposing services to the Internet access.

Using Horizon & ML2 to Simplify TOR Switch Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The usual reason for writing an ML2 driver is to automate configuration of physical switches. But for Lenovo’s typical OpenStack customers, improving ease-of-use is more important. Smaller-scale deployments with inexperienced operators are commonplace in our market. We will explain how we implemented two functions with big ease-of-use benefits: Mapping TOR switch ports to VMs inside Horizon; and automatic VLAN to VxLAN remapping

Using Neutron BGP to Dynamically Route IPv6 Tenant Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron provides floating IPv4 address to allow access to instances within it's private IPv4 tenant network from the internet, but Neutron does not provide floating IPv6 address to access IPv6 tenant network because IPv6 network doesn't need to be NATed. Address Scopes will allow to define L3 routed domains instead of forcing NAT on tenant routers, while BGP will automatically advertise new created subnets. This presentation will mainly explore how to use them to dynamically route IPv6 per-tenant network. With just a little bit of routing help from Neutron BGP, we can actually ping directly in to IPv6 tenant network which is in the same address scope as IPv6 external network. In this session we can have a better understanding of Neutron IPv6 feature, Neutron BGP feature, Neutron Address Scope feature etc.

War Story: How we built a scalable and reliable Neutron driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron’s northbound API can be integrated with networking backends such as SDN controllers via either monolithic core plugins or ML2 drivers. Each option provides a well defined interface, but how these integrations interact with their respective backends varies, sometimes significantly, trying to solve a common set of well known challenges: Reliability Scalability Availability State synchronization and consistency For several releases, Cisco has provided an ML2 mechanism driver integrating Neutron with our ACI SDN controller. After many successful customer deployments and lessons learned regarding its limitations, we decided to revisit our driver’s architecture. We want to share with the developer and operator communities our story of how we designed a Neutron driver that tackles the above problems through the use of asynchronous calls and eventual consistency. We will describe the options considered, the choices made, the results achieved, and some potential Neutron enhancements.

What does it take to integrate Octavia with a Container Orchestration Engine. What is it good for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Elastic containerized services rely on Load Balancing (LB) functionality to be implicitly provided by the platform. In k8s, kube-proxy acts an implicit distributed LB but its capabilities are limited to L2-L3 and cannot be easily extended beyond this. At the same time, OpenStack Octavia allows deploying multiple function-rich LB nodes in several different topology configurations and to expose it as a service through industry standard LBaaSv2 API. In this talk, we explore the possibilities whereby Octavia and k8s can be mutually beneficial and demonstrate several integration scenarios: Octavia as a service in k8s clouds interconnected by Neutron networks through the Kuryr integration layer; Octavia LB between a service tier implemented by VMs and a service tier implemented by k8s containers; Openstack with lightweight containerized Octavia service deployed over k8s. We demonstrate how the proposed solution is enabled by several SDN-based Neutron backends, namely Midonet and OVN.

800 hosts, a solid sandbox to run crash tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Huge infrastructure leads to huge problems! With public cloud, you need to manage thousands of bare metal servers, the problems you will encounter then are totally different from those with a rather small infrastructure. The best way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. With such matters you cannot learn by playing with toy models, we thus had no other choice but to run a real scaled infrastructure, call our crazy monkeys to crash the system and unplug different components, both hardware and software. During this journey, come with us to learn what we discovered, what we fixed and how we improved our recovery time to prevent new crashes. There was born our Crash Test infrastructure with more than 800 physical hosts.

How OpenStack Cloud helped Transform iLayers Service provision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

iLayer has been providing Cloud Services to it's clients in Europe for many years. Being firmly committed to Open Source solutions this infastructure was initially built using IBM Hardware and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server capabilities, such as KVM. One massive limitation of the environment that we built was the Self Service aspect of cloud that has become a key capability for service provision, also the administration burden on iLayer to manage the environment reduced the productivity of our delivery model. With the advent of OpenStack we have been able to move from this highly intensive, mangement heavy environment offering limited customer autonomy to a much more poweful Infrastructure as a Service allowing us and our customers to gain. Join us and discuss how our journey to an OpenStack Cloud helped.

If I could go back: lessons learned after 4 years of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Constant Contact began building its private cloud with the OpenStack "Folsom" release in early 2013. Today, the majority of Constant Contact's web services are now hosted on OpenStack. Nearly 4 years and 7 releases later, our small team of operators has accrued a long and colorful list of practices, stories, and regrets. This talk is directed atÂ our past selves, still in theÂ planning process, and looks back at what we got wrong, what we got right, andÂ applies lessons learned to our future plans. To support a continuously growing cloud with a small team, we've been pragmatic about which services to provide, done extensive work to integrate OpenStack with our existing infrastructure, and designed a deployment that exaggerates our team's strengths. The resulting cloud may not be conventional, but it meets our needs and is low maintenance.

One control plane to rule them all:­ Managing physical and  virtual infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Real production experience using Ironic is scarce­­ and it's even more scarce when combined with Nova for VMs. The general problem is the need to provide a single API layer and portal for managing bare­metal servers and virtual machines in a data center to make end­users' lives easier and even moreso in the multi­datacenter use­case when you either need to have single control plane to manage them all or share permissions across multiple OpenStack deployments. Additionally, users need to provision servers for their apps with an easy-­to­use virtualization layer. We will share our experience at Symantec in using Ironic and Nova in a single OpenStack deployment to enable both cases.

Telemetry: Practice In Large-scale Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We have a more than 300 nodes OpenStack enviroment. With scale came the challenges of operations and telemetry of this cloud. We enhanced our monitor system with ceilometer, aodh, zabbix and other monitoring software. We use independent message queue system to improve stability and isolation, and redesigned the way we record the metric and samples to deal with high concurrent queries and manage data life cycle. And change cluster form to improve the writing ability of database. Then we try to collect physical machine monitoring information with other software and send them to ceilometer for unified storage and preparing for alarm.

The nightmare of Ironic Standalone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ironic is the Bare Metal provisioning service of OpenStack project whose role and features will be quickly reminded first. One aspect of Ironic is that it can be used standalone, without the other OpenStack component. So we proposed that approach to one of our customers who had that use case. However, when you want to do that to control UEFI based servers using an ilo-agent, on non yet released platforms, then the nightmare begins ! You first need to understand how all that works, and there is lots of developer docs but much less operation ones. And then you deal with areas much less tested so you have to report bugs, provide patches, contact some key developers in order to make it work. With Bifrost, will we be able to transform our nightmare into a dream for our customer ? Come to this session to know. Simple recorded demos will be displayed in order to illustrate the different aspects covered during the presentation.

2nd Days of Operations Handled by Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot of requests come from users after stating a cloud. - want to allocate instances booted from same image on separated hypervisors but in same AZ due to performance and HA of their app - want to make a resource reservation for expected future usageThe requests make day2 operations more complicated. When you maintain hypervisors, where will you migrate instances on the hypervisors? When a number of available virtual resources is less than demands, how do you get the available capacity?This talk presents how the complexity of operation resolved by Policy. Congress, Governance as a Service, provides operators with a range of ways to manage and control their cloud by Policy. This will also show you real use case of requests from user and how policies resolving the operation complexity.

99.99 success is too small: measuring Nova build failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud providers regularly provide statistics about the "number of 9s" they havefor API uptime. This can help attract enterprise customers that care aboutreliability. This talk shows how Rackspace goes a bit deeper internally in calculatingthe percentage of builds that fail in Nova, covering our current technicalsolution, how this has helped us discover failure scenarios and prioritize bugfixes, and what the future of build success measurement might look like. Technologies used in the system to calculate build failures include Novanotifications, Stacktach, Logstash, and Elasticsearch. Periodic synthetic buildsto emulate customer experience also run to catch errors that wouldn't bevisible from within the control plane, like network failures after an instancegoes active or issues within the deployed image. The goal of this talk is to encourage operators of OpenStack, especially thosewith large deployments, to measure reliability accurately.

A tool to test and tune your OpenStack Cloud? Sharing our 1000 node China Mobile experience.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It is difficult to be confident about your cloud deployment with the many things you need to consider, particular without the ability to measure its performance and stability before making it production. It is even harder to locate annoying bottlenecks, tune the cloud, and confirm whether the optimizations really work. China Mobile kindly allowed us to test, against their 1000 node cluster, our profiling tool that non-intrusively tracks each virtual machine boot request every step of the way. We could dial up and down incoming request rates to identify bottlenecks. With the ability to enumerate every possible state of a request, we were able to troubleshoot the cloud quickly. Combined with monitoring tools, we adjusted the deployment making it 3.3 times faster and 100% stable under 800 concurrent requests per second. Confidence born through experimentation. Quality of Service Assurances backed by data. Come see how we achieved this feat and explore our profiling and analytics tools.

A Visit from St. Dynatrace, Patron of Digital Performance Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Twas the night before go live and no one was calm,The sysadmin stood by with sweat in his palm,You might wonder what was the occasion,Twas deployment time without DPM in the equation. Digital performance management, as every child knows,Keeps your users/customers happy and makes them no foes, From the first line of code to production deployments,Keeping in line your application's performance. What has this to do with OpenStack?If your app runs on nova and gets out of whack,You should be in the lucky position,To troubleshoot the control plane and your app in correlation. With numerous services and logs to be found,You’re experience with OpenStack should be rather profound.With huge deployments where changes are constant,It’s easy to lose track of what is important. If that’s the case, then don’t despair,I’ll help you sleep well and keeping your hair,So listen closely and see what to do,To get an holistic environment overview.

Accelerate the OpenStack Root Cause Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a multi-layered cloud infrastructure with many complex internal and external dependencies: Software, Hardware, Storage, OS and Networking. Hence, when the system is troubled, you need to run multiple commands and check different areas before you can define where to perform a deep dive troubleshooting. The objective here is to shorten the initial investigation and focus on the most probable cause of the issue.   This is leveraging the knowledge accumulated by escalation engineers while managing real customer environments running OpenStack. Therefore, we know what are the main checkpoints. And, we can automate the diagnostic without having to open the UI. This also provides a good snapshot (as-built) of the system configuration at different points of time.

Adaptive OpenStack Troubleshooting: Bridging the gap between logging and monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Attend this session to know about an automated system that integrates Monasca and logging services to provide the right context for an operator to triage issues. This involves creating a log handler component that listens, detects issues and configures the log levels based on the current state of issues.  A logging agent runs on service nodes and tracks the log level of services. It periodically communicates with the monitoring service over a secure channel. Any error detected in the centralized log metrics by Monasca would automatically trigger an alarm along with a feedback to the logging agent running on relevant hosts to switch the log level. This provides context in the centralized log messages when an operator watches the logging dashboard. Once the issue is resolved, Monasca auto detects this and switches the log level of the service. A Horizon dashboard will be provided to the operators to control log levels for services on demand. The session will conclude with a live demo!

Bots like Siri and Echo have popularized the emerging area of smart chat bots. We would like to highlight a smart way of using chat bots in the space of Ops monitoring and DevOps. A few direct applications include: repetitive mundane tasks (disk cleanup, workflow based jobs etc.), system health monitoring, using Chat logs for effective triaging, creating post-mortem reports and learning from knowledge bases. Using analytics and smart rules, bots enable constant learning of system behavior and can be empowered to take smart decisions.  The holy grail in this world of bots is to remove the human, and let the bots take control of the operations!   We would like to invite the community to get involved and help us drive a Bots revolution in the Openstack Ops community.

Ansible + OpenStack: Who, What, Where, Why, and How?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Want to learn how to automate the deployment, management, and consumption of an OpenStack cloud with Ansible? In this talk, Robyn Bergeron, Community Architect for Ansible, will share her knowledge around the various ways - and whys! - OpenStack and Ansible are used together. Numerous projects inside of OpenStack depend upon, or are built solely upon, Ansible, including Bifrost, Kolla, and openstack-ansible, as well as the CI system for OpenStack itself, operated by OpenStack's infrastructure team. Additionally, modules inside of Ansible, maintained by members of the OpenStack community, make it easy to abstract the complexities of OpenStack in an automated fashion. If you're new to Ansible, the session's demonstration of some of Ansible's OpenStack modules will show how easy it can be. And if you're an experienced user? Get to know how some of OpenStack's projects are making advanced usage of Ansible, or find out how you can participate in any of these open source communities.

Architectures, tools and best practices for diagnosing and monitoring OpenStack deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The use of ELK (Elastic, Logstash and Kibana) and variants (EFK - Elastic, Fluentd and Kibana) for log aggregation has been well documented. What is missing is how aggregated logging can be used for advanced diagnostics, monitoring and auditing in OpenStack. The answer starts with capturing the right data, cleaning of data with filtering, addition of metadata at various stages of the log data pipeline and finally to visualize the indexed data with advanced queries and dashboards built using Kibana. Come share our experiences with log collection, filtering, metadata addition and visualization of logs using ELK stack in OpenStack environment. For instance, you might learn how to write and save a Kibana query when “nova instance fails to boot”.  Or you might learn how to create a Kibana dashboard that monitors the health of your OpenStack environment. And more with real screenshots and demos.

Augmented Reality for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Smartphone-based augmented reality (AR) is now surprisingly easy to create: with mature, cross-platform, open source tools like ARToolkit providing powerful base functions for camera calibration, feature tracking, and dynamic rendering of 3D content over realtime video views. This presentation describes (and demonstrates) how phone-based augmented reality can be exploited to facilitate OpenStack cloud operations: providing heads-up informational displays elucidating the status and interactions of workloads and processes active on physical hardware, and enabling creation and interaction with virtual 3D models on tabletops or other empty 'stages.' The proposed architecture draws from an opensource toolchain rooted in Mirantis Stacklight, which is a sophisticated logging, monitoring, and alerting kit comprising components such as ElasticSearch, InfluxDB, Kibana, and Grafana.

Automated OS Image building for fun and profit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

How to keep your OS images up-to-date? How to customize and harden the images? What if the vendor provided “one-size-fits-all image” doesn't suit your needs? Well – go and build your own! At CeBIT 2016 Deutsche Telekom launched the Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) as a OpenStack-based public cloud offering. To keep the promise of the marketing slogan “Simple – Secure – Affordable” in regards to our OS images we have built an fully automated, programmatic way, to build our OS images.   This is the Image Factory project!   Utilizing tools like openSUSE kiwi, the OpenStack API suite, git and local repositories we build public images, entirely optimized to run on OTC. The images are built, uploaded, registered and tested fully automatically. Following this approach we are able to apply changes quickly, include security patches in near-realtime and do hardening and customization. And thinking further – we might even open it up to customers as ImageFactory-as-a-service.

Automated Recovery of OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Typical OpenStack deployment tools that exist today do a fairly good job of deployment of the cloud. But what is missing is making use of the information provided by monitoring tools to initiate an automated recovery of the cloud from certain set of well known problems. There are several issues that can happen in an OpenStack cloud post deployment including power loss , network partitions and hardware issues. We will look into recovery procedures for galera, rabbit and also how to integrate with deployment infrastructures to recover from hardware problems.  In this talk we will present a tool(CloudDoctor) to view all open issues in your cloud and an option to fix those issues. We  have a plugin model which integrates with existing monitoring tools and also deployment infrastructures. You could also perform actions like add/remove compute nodes, updates for bug fixes and replace controllers to make sure you can fully recover from existing issues.

Beyond Horizon - Moving the Dashboard to a UX that works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  For years, Horizon has been the undisputed official Dashboard for Openstack, being the very recognizable web interface that serves many private and public cloud providers. But it still brings many unresolved pains: coupling of front-end and backend prevents designers to provide innovative interfaces in modern frameworks (e.g. 3REE), and a "skin" approach the UI/UX is designed by and for sysadmins, and does not consider other use cases no support for popular third party (non Openstack) software solutions for queue management, logging, monitoring, containers, security etc. no addressing of public providers' needs in terms of customer management instead of simple "users": billing, pricing advertising, reporting, charts etc are vital to a proper UX for customers. In this session we will provide a complete overview of a brand new open source project for a modular, extensible, reactive, appealing Openstack dashboard solving most of the pains above.

Building Customised Packages for your OpenStack Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Packages are the key component in operations of an OpenStack cloud. Users can use distro packages built by other companies in their PoC or production system without any changes, however many users want to have customised packages with their own patches. This talk introduces how packages are built for OpenStack projects, and demonstrates how to build customise packages by using StackBuffet: a CI-as-a-Service that automatically builds packages from your source code. StackBuffet has a built-in APT/YUM repository that makes it easy for users to consume these packages. It can also aid testing in different phases from source code testing to final production testing.

BYOS with Ansible: Adding 3rd-party services to your cloud without being broken by upgrade!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We’ve got to the point where a fully automated deployment of OpenStack is not such a big deal. We might even say that we have solved the upgrade problem; maybe not quite as seamless as we’d like, but definitely getting easier. Let’s say you have deployed a private cloud and would like to integrate Neutron with your favourite SDN, which requires additional plugin code, config settings, etc. Or maybe you also need to deploy your own inventory management service across the cloud, which requires certain ports to be open. How do you do this in a way that isn’t broken the next time you upgrade your OpenStack distro? In this session, we will discuss an approach to this problem based on an Ansible framework for deployment and general lifecycle management of the cloud. We will detail how we allow consumers of our private cloud solution to make changes to OpenStack services for integration of different 3rd-party plugins/drivers, with the integration of Neutron and OpenDaylight as an example.

CentOS Opstools SIG and collaboration with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operating an OpenStack cloud infrastructure is a complex task. Running an OpenStack cloud infrastructure turns out to create a complex environment. OpenStack itself does not provide additional tools to handle and to support operators.

Cisco Litmus: Test the pH of Your Cloud!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you struggled to test your development and production clouds?We did too!!! So we created a service to do it for us!Our Quality Engineering team had a goal of automating and unifyingall of the technologies we use to verify our OpenStack clouds. After much experimentation and some false starts, we developed a framework called Litmus.Litmus configures, schedules and runs the following frameworks:1. Tempest2. Rally3. Selenium for Horizon testing4. An in-house framework we call Sanity. It provides users with a clean, polished web UI to make things easy, but also exposes a REST API that can be used by other services. During our presentation, some of the topics we'll discuss are how we've used Litmus to: - Scale our testing to all of of our clouds with distributed worker instances.- Compare region test results.- Create historical data for all of our sites.- Blacklist incompatible tests by OpenStack release.- Make the pain go away.

Cloud Management Platform lowers the threshold for adopting OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is now penetrating data centers at both corporates and service providers. Making the most efficient use of data center assets is a key strategy for successful enterprises. OpenStack is an attractive new innovative alternative. However, when planning how to deploy OpenStack, one must consider how it can co-exist with other virtualization and cloud technologies already in place. How to accomplish this and avoid unwanted complexity is a challenge.

Collectd, InfluxDB & Grafana used to meter OpenStack base infrastructure and services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

To be able to debug complex systems, investigate on their performance and to do capacity planning, metrics of the various components in your cloud are getting very important. While Ceilometer provides metrics and events of OpenStack related components, Cloud Platform Engineers require insights that go beyond that and also need metrics from base infrastructure and services. Thus Swisscom deployed collectd and makes use of its many plugins to collect basic system metrics as well as metrics from services such as HAProxy or RabbitMQ. The metrics are stored and down sampled over time in InfluxDB. In the end Grafana is used to browse and analyze the metrics.In this talk I will introduce the architecture of our metering setup and share the experience with it.

Containers are packages: A premier on build tools and strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Dockerfile can tackle a pretty large number of use cases, enabling a near flat learning curve but its limitations can lead to complexity that degrades performance benefits and space optimizations.  There is a need for organizations building OpenStack themselves from the ground up to repackage multiple components so as OpenStack's infrastructure components get containerized you'll want to become familiar with the image build toolchain that'll replace your RPM and APT toolchains. In this talk I'll introduce the various build tools at your disposal and strategies you can use to reduce the number of Dockerfiles you'll have to maintain.  Plus improve your insight into these images by utilizing declarative configuration management at build time.  As a bonus we'll leverage the the work done by the Puppet OpenStack and Docker communities to illustrate these strategies, proving that you do not need to throw out your entire infrastructure to migrate to a containerized world.

I found that Puppet was a part of my daily life and had become the most important tool for getting things done in my infrastructure.  That fact convinced me that Puppet and automation was going to be the cornerstone of a modern technology stack, a movement I decided I wanted to be a part of.  Since then I've moved from Professional Service through Business Development to SysOps. I am now serving as a Prinicpal SysOps Engineer; where I work with internal and external partners to improve the way everyone utilizes the cloud technologies of today and tomorrow. I do this by staying close to the tech that facilitates the demands of a fast growing software company.)*


Debugging OpenStack Networking Reloaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Networking is one of the least understood component of OpenStack and, consequently, one of the toughtest challenges for operators. It is impossible to diagnose most issues with an OpenStack installation without understanding the networking internals, something impractical to do manually. DON, written primarily in Python, and available as a dashboard in OpenStack Horizon, Libery release, is a network analysis and diagnostic system and provides a completely automated service for verifying and diagnosing the networking functionality of a multi-node OpenStack installation. This service verifies (or points out deviations) that the user configuration is indeed reflected in the underlying infrastructure and presents the results in an intuitive graphical display. The results of the analysis are stored in a DB for later retrieval and comparision. Please visit https://github.com/CiscoSystems/don for more recent information.

Demystifying OpenStack:  Billing and Chargeback Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The #1 priority listed by the most respondents in the spring 2016 OpenStack User Survey was “Saving money over alternative infrastructure choices”.   66% of all respondents listed this first. But how do you know if your OpenStack cloud is saving you money and demonstrate that to your users? A self-service cloud running on OpenStack requires reporting and tools to inform project owners and help them make decisions to right size their resources and control sprawl.  Executives and management require a different set of reports and metrics to determine services mix and plan for staffing and resource growth.  This presentation will focus on practical considerations for implementing chargeback and capacity planning in order to make informed choices and increase resource utilization.

Detecting Black Holes and Micro-bursts with Telemetry Tools for Application Assurance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Service Level Agreements (SLA) for applications are often taken for granted as connectivity and traffic management just works without any glitch. However, when problems arise, tracing packet flows and root causing issues are very complicated in cloud networks by virtue of technologies involved, further complicating application SLA compliance in cloud networks. With multi-tenant networks, ensuring application SLAs is a critical aspect of design as various applications/organizations share the same physical and virtual infrastructure resources. This session will address the following topics: Monitor micro-bursts, traffic flow for application SLA Packet tracing and injection for root cause analysis   Mapping overlay and underlay packet flows Scaling monitoring and analytics for high density data centers

Effective Distributed Monitoring and Load Balancing using Consul
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Current monitoring tools like nagios etc are good for simpleton health checks. But the onus is still on the users to write scripts or manually take actions when the alarm triggers. Current monitoring apps operate like IFTT (IF this Then That). We need our applications to self-heal in the cloud environment. At least significantly reduce the downtime while firefighting issues. In this session, we’ll provide a different perspective on not only monitoring your applications, but also automatically scaling it and effectively load balancing them. We leverage Consul’s key features such as dns interface, key-value store, distributed locks to enable an effective distributed monitoring strategy. In this talk, we'll share our experience on how to we ushered into microservices infrastructure from a monolithic application and how to leverage consul for monitoring, service discovery and load balancing applications deployed to cloud.

ELK Storage Analytics: Logarithmic Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack has become somewhat of a standard as an OpenStack log management service. Elasticsearch, the immensely popular search engine, requires an immense amount of storage, by nature -- but how much is enough storage? How long can you maintain current measures before you need to add more memory? How will changing your log retention as per HIPAA compliance affect your storage capacity? This dilemma can be solved using the growing log information we have available to us along with mathematical analytics. In this talk, we’ll cover how we try to make sense of the data available to us, what deducing methods we use to craft equations for prediction models, and how more research work of this type can allow us to effectively and efficiently tackle problems of similar complexity.

Exploring invisible problems in OpenStack - intelligent troubleshooting with the Elastic Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Troubleshooting OpenStack is difficult. In a real-world OpenStack system, configurations, parameters and architectures are all different in every OpenStack deployment. So, regardless of OpenStack maturity, we've found multiple problems in our OpenStack system, which often come out as error logs but sometimes not. In the latter case, problems are especially difficult to detect and fix. In this presentation, we will introduce how to manage this problem by using the Elastic Stack, not just parsing error log messages but taking more intelligent approaches. To detect invisible errors and problems, such as performance degradation caused by Keystone, DB and RabbitMQ, we have configured the Elastic Stack to collect log data in a way appropriate for analysis, extracting plenty of important information, e.g. request IDs, request URLs, response times of WSGI servers. We will show how to utilize these data for troubleshooting OpenStack and results of log data analysis in our OpenStack system.

Extending OpenStack-Ansible with Automated Operational Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The IBM Systems Cloud Solutions Group helps many customers realize their own private OpenStack Cloud infrastructures. Recently we looked into how to best handle this task using exclusively open community solutions. For provisioning we settled on the OpenStack-Ansible project. We have used it heavily and became familiar with its strengths and weaknesses. In addition we had to complement our solution with open DevOps tools to fulfil Operational Management aspects, such as Monitoring, Log Collection & Analysis, Performance, Scalability, Discovery and Inventory Management, among others. In this session we share our findings. In particular we show our approach to integrate a stack of Ops tools with OpenStack-Ansible for automated deployment and configuration. We also discuss how to adjust the Ops configuration elastically in order to achieve immediate coverage after our Cluster scales or when it is reconfigured. We expect that our experience and ideas will help similar endeavors.

Failure Analysis Under a Multi-Components Public Cloud Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Our company, NTT Communications, provides the public/hosted private cloud service "Enterprise Cloud 2.0” with OpenStack. For cloud service providers, downtime reduction is essential and thus many operation tools that support failure detection and analysis have been deployed. In our company, we have been using monitoring tools (TeMIP, Zabbix etc.) since the previous cloud service; however it takes a long time to conduct failure analysis across multi-component OpenStack-based cloud service because failure causes are more complex. Our goal is to develop an effective failure analysis tool. To achieve this goal, we added some functions such as "the automatic analysis of states/logs along the service procedure flow", "the cause suggestion based on dependency learning" after analyzing failure cases. These improvements have helped us conduct a failure analysis of service down (instance creation failure etc.) more quickly. In this presentation, we share our development knowledge and use cases.

Formal method techniques to guarantee consistency of security policy in virtual machine migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Dynamic changes is the key to any cloud infrastructure like OpenStack. Maintaining consistency of information while being dynamic in nature is tricky. Particularly during VM migration the global information like security policy, service level agreement etc. can become inconsistent. In such scenario Formal Method techniques can be used to verify the consistency of such critical information. We propose to show how the formal method techniques can be used to mathematically prove the consistency of crucial information while migrating the VMs across physical hosts.

From Bare Metal to CMDB: ITIL as Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has demonstrated the usefulness of an infrastructure controlled as Code, through the usage of standard APIs usable from a great variety of tools (Web dashboard, CLI and Programmatic tools). But operators need to go one step further. And today the technology and the tools are there to help them bridge the gap. With a new Open Source project called Alexandria, we aim at providing a multi-purpose aggregation brick bridging the gap. It combines, through drivers, OpenStack components such as Ironic, standards such as Redfish for HW Compute resource and CMDBs such as the Open Source iTop to provide to customers a full end to end "ITIL as Code" solution. This allows operators to keep the benefits of their ITIL approach, with a central tool gathering assets, relationships, impact measurement, incident management, ... and to have a fine grained control of their infrastructure... as code. Some recorded demo will be presented to illustrate the promise of this approach.

How to charge your clients?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

After the deployment and the integration of an OpenStack environment it is a common use case to charge the users for provided and consumed resources, regardless of whether it is a public or a private cloud. While there are feasible metering services in OpenStack, billing and rating based on the metering data still is a major nuisance. We will outline the existing metering and billing solution we evaluated for the use at Betacloud and show how we integrated one solution with an online service for quoting and billing.

Increase Utilization Without Killing Your SLAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack clouds *can* be highly efficient when it comes to resource utilization. In practice, however, fear of violating SLAs leads to gross over­subscription, provisioning far more infrastructure than should be necessary. In fact, utilization rates under 20% are not uncommon. In this session, we’ll look at how new approaches like Soft Container can isolate containers to make better use of idle resources, responding dynamically to increase utilization while safeguarding SLAs. Participants will get an overview of new resource utilization and scheduling techniques, and the session will provide an analysis of how resource interference impacts co-­located applications, and the way to mitigate this.

Islands in the Stream - Consuming OpenStack services for more than just OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, you’ll learn the benefits of running OpenShift Container Platform on top of OpenStack. This allows your OpenShift environment to not only run in OpenStack instances, but also consume other OpenStack resources, such as Cinder volumes and Keystone authentication. Why recreate the wheel with islands of infrastructure? You can keep it all streamlined and available to both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).One of the key benefits of OpenShift is the ability to run legacy apps, which are generally stateful and require persistent storage, in a container. We will show you how OpenShift can dynamically provision Cinder volumes from OpenStack and mount those to containers running in your PaaS. In addition, if you have already spent the time perfecting your Keystone authentication configuration, we will show you how you can leverage that versus having yet another authentication configuration for another platform.

It’s 2016, Cloud is Advanced and Your Orchestration Engine Needs a PhD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operations and Management has for too long been seen as the harbinger of doom for IT. Much of this is because the greater advances in technology are driving higher demand for IT management capability. These demands have gone beyond a human ability to analyze innumerous elements and swiftly take the appropriate course of action. This lead Accenture to introduce the “Intelligent Orchestration Engine” for OpenStack. Accenture begins by giving the orchestration engine a PhD. in data analytics and performance optimization. The addition of intelligence combined with the workflow requirements has created a holistic and enhanced approach to automation and orchestration. These orchestration workflows algorithmically make decisions that solve inefficiencies before they become incidents or problems. This approach allows Accenture to close gaps found in traditional orchestration and take a homogeneous approach to managing the business, technology, and compliance needs.

Kolla: Operating OpenStack Clouds in Docker Containers using Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kolla is an OpenStack big tent project that deploys and operates OpenStack cloud environments using Ansible and Docker. In past presentations of Kolla, we have always talked about the technology behind Kolla as the key factor in what makes Kolla fantastic.  Over the last 18 months our IRC channel has built a tight feedback co-development loop with operators participating in the Kolla community.  The best part for operators is we have maintained our technology strengths during this change in our philosophy. With this unintended consequence of operator interaction, we have not only solved the #1 pain point (deployment) and #2 pain point (upgrades) of OpenStack, but are quickly building a tight feedback loop with operators to solve the #3 pain point (operators have unmet requirements).

Learn how to use Nagios and StackStorm to automate the recovery of OpenStack services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

I will explain why and how I created an automated deployment of a test environment using Vagrant and Ansible to deploy and configure it. The background behind this is that I needed a reliable test environment for testing new deployments and upgrades as well as running OpenStack demos.  Occassionally I found the demo environment had developed an issue just before I ran a demo so I needed a way to monitor it and ideally get it 'self heal' so it would always be ready to go. A live demo (praying to the demo gods) will show the automatic recovery of services following a simulated failure. All materials will be made availabe after the talk enabling the re-creation of the test environment.

MAAS 2.0: hyperscale-grade physical automation for the masses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Managing phyiscal infrastructure is a pain in the ass. That is, except if you are one of the Big Three, and have a hairy, powerful and entirely homegrown system which can discover, configure and deploy any hardware you might want to purchase. Actually, it turns out that the essential functionality you find in Google, Facebook and Amazon's toolkit is now available to anybody, free of charge. MAAS is an open source tool which is used to automate deployment of bare metal at scale, and which is increasingly seen underneath large and growing OpenStack clouds. MAAS a web UI, but the most powerful way to use it is through its cloud-style API, which lets you ask for physical infrastructure as if it were completely software-defined. As in "give me a server with at least 24 cores and 96GB of memory, configure its two 10GBe NICs into a bond, and deploy Windows on it".

Maat - Adaptive System Configuration and Recovery with Predicates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Maat is an SCM system with automatic system recovery. It defines system correctness with simple predicates and can adaptively find solutions to recover from system resource changes. We will demonstrate Maat provisioning an OpenStack cluster and recovering from system changes. * System correctness is specified with simple predicate functions in Python. * Reconfigurations for system changes achieve minimal disruption of service. * Operators can be notified and control when a system reconfiguration is required to avoid thrashing during transient failures. * User-defined fitness functions select solutions that optimize system characteristics such as resource usage and disposition. We developed Maat to automate the life cycle of OpenStack clusters, from initial provisioning, failure recovery, cluster component changes, and software upgrades. We will demonstrate Maat deploying and recovering from failures on a multi-node DevStack deployment.

Managing Your Cloud, the CIS Way!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When your cloud's hypervisor list spans multiple pages, it is very easy to get lost in the complexity. If it takes half an hour just to figure out which nodes are running a service, or track down all of the dependent services, then debugging any issue quickly becomes overwhelming.The Cloud Intelligence Service (CIS) acts as the single source of truth for your cloud fleet metadata. This includes metadata of virtual and physical resources , policies, configuration and billing. It aggregates and analyses events from infrastructure services to derive correlation between resources and trigger actions for optimizing the cloud. Built on top of Elasticsearch and integrating ChatOps, CIS provides cloud operators with unparalleled visibility. The capabilities include: History of state changes for cloud metadata objects A searchable web interface & API  Building reports for cost analysis, security, platform optimization etc Join us to see how CIS can light the path through your cloud.

Monitoring OpenStack: a comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operators are generally unhappy with monitoring OpenStack in general. There are too many tools. There are too many places in OpenStack that require monitoring.It's not clear how and what to monitor. The amount of monitoring will have a performance impact on the whole cloud. How do you learn information about a host / service that needs monitored beforehand? How can this information be easily / automatically discovered? Traditional service monitoring? Tenant health monitoring? Expose this monitoring to tenants? Provide monitoring as a service for tenants? What is the best approach? a comparison.

My spider sensu is tingling!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most of the OpenStack core projects are currently considered stable and can be installed plug-and-play fashion. Although most of the time everything seems to work fine, anyone operating an OpenStack environment dreads errors appearing silently in the background where they might stay undiscovered while they are not affecting anybody. Some of these might not be worth looking into, but some of them might cause serious trouble later on.During the last few years, many monitoring solutions have evolved around OpenStack or plug-ins for existing ones have been developed. This session introduces a few Open Source options for monitoring your OpenStack cluster. We will outline the monitoring solution we are currently using at cloudbau and Betacloud, which is based on Sensu, InfluxDB, Grafana, Elasticsearch and Collectd. We will finally conclude why we think that Open Source and community-driven solutions are best suited for monitoring OpenStack environments.

Network visibility and Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud operations is spending a lot of time doing network related tasks manually which is adding to delays in deploying applications. Some of them include getting subnet(s) and configuring them either on a new or existing rack. It is error prone and time consuming. They are also spending time debugging duplicate IPs and mostly reactive in nature to address new capacity needs. Some of the reasons for this range from manual errors, multiple sources of truth causing maintenance issues, shared network addressing and visibility.This talk will focus on addressing these issues using an external IPAM and building automation around it. The topics covered will include the following which will significantly improve operations and time spent from day(s) to hours or minutes.1. Automate configuration of subnets in neutron2. Avoidance of IP conflicts3. Visibility of current IP usage and plan for future allocation

One for All: Deploying OpenStack, Ceph or Cloud Foundry with a Unified Deployment Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying production-ready OpenStack is a complex process that asks for a lot of knowledge. Next to OpenStack often other services do exist in a data center which have different constraints. A unified deployment tool significantly reduces the workload for operators and developers.Crowbar is a mature and extensible Open Source provisioning framework wich makes it easy to rapidly, and flexibly deploy OpenStack clouds, Ceph storage setups or other software stacks like Cloud Foundry on OpenStack onto bare metal.

Openstack, Ansible, & Ironic: making baremetal deployments easy!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying OpenStack has been considered the wild west frontier for some time, but then along came OpenStack Ansible which has made it simple for operators to deploy production OpenStack, making use of Ansible and lxc containers. Not content with the basic set of OpenStack components, a small band of developers set out with a plan to add Ironic to the list of supported services, resulting in the development of the os_ironic role. Join us as we talk about our journey to add baremetal provisioning to the OpenStack Ansible project. We will discuss how we made it easy to deploy and support OpenStack across not just containers, but also baremetal (introducing yet another buzzword)! Come and hear about the challenges we faced, how they were overcome, and what we learnt in the process. We’ll also gaze into the future and talk about what the next steps might be, and how you can help us get there.

Operation tool to make OpenStack operation easy and accelerate operation speed on multi regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NTT Communications provides the public cloud service by OpenStack which is Enterprise Cloud 2.0(ECL2.0) from this March. Our regions will be Japan, UK, Singapore, US, Australia, Hong Kong and Germany this October. In the near future, the regions will expand to 14. We created our ops tool (Operation Portal) with GUI. Operators who aren’t familiar with OpenStack can operate ECL2.0 and find which customer was affected by failure and when failure happened and was recovered by this tool. Our main target is enterprise customers. The customers in Japan expect high quality operation. ECL2.0 provides IaaS with High Availability. However our customers are not satisfied with only HA. They want a notification. Therefore operators look into failure and send a notification to them by Operation Portal. We will expand operation team to our affiliate company in India for controlling multi regions this October. Operation Portal fills in the gap of operation between Japan and India.

Optimizing OpenStack Performance with Genetic Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Optimizing OpenStack for api response time and minimal instance-to-instance latency is a difficult and time-consuming process, but has an enormous long-term impact on user satisfaction. Operators must balance dozens (or hundreds) of values, and many of these values impacting other parts of the system in unexpected and often suprising ways. We explore this "emergent behavior" for further optimizations by applying a genetic algorithm to the configuration superset of an OpenStack deployment.

Orchestrate once, deploy everywhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Installing an application once is easy, but what happens if you want to write an application that works on top of AWS, OpenStack and Bare Metal?  In this talk, we'll describe some batteries-included software we've written, deployed, and operated atop multiple public and private clouds using Kubernetes from a single set of installer tooling.  We'll also describe how we made it resilient to failures such that we can remove our bare metal nodes and kill our cloud nodes without requiring operator intervention.

Oslo Config as a Service (CONFaaS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is an highly customizable based on the deployment scenarios. This is accomplished by enabling each and every component of OpenStack to start with Oslo configuration files. In small deployment, its easy for user to login to the deployment nodes such as controller or compute node and update the configuration files. But this become an cumbersome task when the number of deployment nodes multiplies exponentially for supporting larger cloud base. This could be easier if there is common Horizon dashboard or OpenStack CLI to configure the OpenStack components across multiple deployed nodes. In OpenStack there is no such feature exist today. This problem is addressed by introducing new concept 'Oslo Config as a Service (CONFaaS)' to OpenStack.

Practical OpenStack Operations: What happens after Day 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You now have a fully deployed OpenStack Cloud. Great. You made the right decision. But what happens next? This presentation looks into the most common operational problems that a typical Cloud administrator will face after day 1: security, currency, monitoring, problem detection, analysis & resolution, scalability and configuration elasticity, among others. It will compare capabilities of familiar DevOps tools, such as Ansible, Juju/MaaS, Nagios/Icinga, Zabbix, ELK, Ganglia, Grafana, etc. The DevOps landscape is extensive and it can be confusing to understand the pros and cons of a particular stack of applications to complement Cloud operation needs. It's our goal in to clarify the available options and categorize them, while emphasizing their differences, strengths and weaknesses. Lastly we discuss best practices to integrate them with OpenStack to achieve flexible and effortless Cloud operations.

Quick Triaging of common OpenStack issues using Ansible.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As part of troubleshooting issues in an openstack cloud, admin runs through various checkpoints to find the root cause and spends a lot of time in repeating the same troubleshooting steps for multiple occurrences of the same issue. We have captured the common troubleshooting checkpoints and created ansible playbooks that will run through the troubleshooting steps quickly and helps to narrow down the problem. For example, one of the common issue in the cloud is VM not getting an IP. To triage, an admin has to go through multiple manual troubleshooting steps like finding whether the qdhcp for the network is created (or) whether the ports are active and so on. By running the triage playbook that already contains these troubleshooting steps, common checkpoints are validated and the root cause is identified quickly. Agenda:1. How the playbooks are developed with the checkpoints using Ansible2. How to add more checkpoints to the playbooks3. Illustrate with examples

RDO's pipeline with Software Factory and DLRN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The first task of an OpenStack operator is deciding how to install it. If ambitious, you could install from source, although packages might prove more prudent. This talk covers the new way that RDO builds OpenStack packages with a completely open toolchain, and how you can too. This is immensely useful for building your own packages safely, tested by upstream and in-house tests and gates. Red Hat recently underwent a complete shift in how packages are built and delivered using Software Factory. Software Factory is a distribution of software that closesly resembles the development environment of the upstream OpenStack project. This has allowed us to build and test packages and entire repositories continuously. Come to this talk to learn how this software set has allowed us to accelerate our development and deployment pace, and how you can leverage it to bring the same advantages to your own cloud.

Reclaim those unused instances, images: Mors - Lease Management for OpenStack objects.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A large section of OpenStack is used is for running Dev, Test or Sales lab. Lab means creating a large number of objects (Instances, Images, Volumes, etc). OpenStack makes creating these objects really easy, but deletion of unused items is always forgotten. Introducing Mors - a simple service that will help reclaim precious computing and storage resources. Using Mors you can set up expiration lease policies on Instances and Images per tenant, upon expiration of the lease Mors will warn owners of images or instances. Users will be able to extend their expiration leases in a constrained manner, failure to do so will mean Mors will either power-off or delete the instances. It is simple to understand and very effective. In this talk author would present how to configure and user Mors for your own OpenStack environment. Furthermore, you will also learn how to add support for more OpenStack objects to the Mors framework and extend it further.

Save your money in a different way: A Framework for Dynamic Consolidation of VMs in Openstack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Currently, cloud data centers consume huge amounts of electrical energy, and operators spend much money on energy costs. Does there have a way to relieve this situation? Our team consider that dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) is an efficient approach for improving the utilization of physical resources and reducing energy consumption in cloud data centers. By using decision-making algorithms and VMs live mirgration in Nova project according to their real-time resource demand, this solution will re-allocate those resources and switch idle hosts to the sleep mode. Furthermore, more important resources in OpenStack can be considered too, like Volumes in storage. So we want to share our study and a open source platform in OpenStack that implement the prototype of this idea. Wish this will bring more thinkings and choices to cloud operators.

Scaling Atomic Host with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Leveraging containers at scale presents unique challenges. Using an operating system that is optimized for containers is essential. Red Hat Atomic Host is designed for clustering containers in production. It is fully supported and backed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.In this session we will discuss the fundamental concepts of what containers actually are doing inside the Linux kernel. We will then go through a real-world demonstration that deploys a simple web application multiple times with multiple persistent storage backends in a single Atomic Host cluster. This application platform can will be scaled using Heat auto-scaling.Using this fundamental understanding, reinforced by practical examples, attendees will walk away with a better idea of how to leverage containers in their own infrastructure. In addition to this, all of the demo code is available as an Ansible playbook that attendees can use to replicate and expand the entire demo environment on their own.

First, an inventory fabric to manage your inventory of hosts/devices, along with corresponding configuration variables; and the ability to wrap seamlessly existing inventory/asset management sources. Second, Craton enables running audit and remediation workflows across the fleet to help operate your cloud. Integration APIs complete the solution with other tooling you have in place, including CI/CD, governance, logging, monitoring, and alerting.

Skydive - Follow up on your favorite network and protocol analyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SDN solutions are complex and troubleshooting/monitoring them is even harder. Skydive provides a non-intrusive way to visualize the network topology, and analyze and identify the root cause of network issues. We presented Skydive at the last summit in Austin. Since then, a lot has happened in the project, thanks to the feedbacks of the Skydive early adopters :   Tracking of the whole network topology and traffic changes eBPF probes for ultra light traffic capture overhead Improved querying capabilities to integration Skydive in operation tools Deeper introspection of traffic Better container integration with support of Kubernetes and OpenShift Traffic generation This talk will introduce those features and show how they help operators troubleshoot and monitor network environments, and will present what’s coming next.

Sleep Better at Night: OpenStack Cloud Auto­-Healing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Software­-defined everything is a new trend. How about software­-defined outage prevention and remediation? You have your cloud up and running. You monitor it through StackLight, Zabbix, Nagios or some other tool. But what's happening when one of the services is unresponsive or your free disk space is low? How quickly will you able to resolve the issue? Do you have any debugging information or logs gathered before you actually start digging into the issue? We will introduce a “robo­sysadmin” for our production OpenStack cloud that reacts to alerts and outages and helps us to speed up mean time to repair by gathering debug information and trying to fix issues automatically using predefined workflows. It’s a kind of Tier 0 support: it troubleshoots, fixes known problems, escalates to humans when necessary, and provides detailed information on what it has discovered.

StackTask, Granular Roles and RBAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deployment of public, production OpenStack Cloud regions present all manner of challenges, not least of which being the management and delegation of user permissions and roles. Our users have long requested the ability to delegate roles more granular than "_member_", reset passwords securely and invite new users to their own projects; none of which being easily done with base unfederated Keystone or the default policies. We present the method by which we enabled our users to self-manage a significant amount of this (within controlled boundaries), leaving more time for our engineers to develop new features, expand our regions, and sleep peacefully at night.Principally: * Limitations in Keystone, Horizon and the APIs, and the reasons behind them. * Concepts, design goals and architecture in StackTask that overcome many of these. * Horizon dashboard integration. * Rate limiting. * Modification of default RBAC policies to include more granular roles.

Taking Role Based Access Control into the the next generation with Tempest Driven Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The role of RBAC policies is to restrict access to the capabilities of OpenStack API’s and provide controlled access to authorized users. This follows the principle of least privilege. To this effect AT&T has undertaken the task of creating certain buckets (set of atomic API calls) that enable certain functionality. Implementation of RBAC policies required vigorous testing through all phases of the SDLC. Tempest is the test automation tool used to test API and CLI tests to validate the Openstack deployment. The team has extended the Tempest framework and designed a role based control mechanism to insert assertions depending on the type of role and API. The framework is driven by a simple excel spreadsheet that has roles and the type of assertion required. API tests are then executed based on the defined roles & expected assertions. The framework has been very successful in testing out all the different roles defined throughout the different phases of testing using CI/CD.

The DevOps Train Wreck Headed for Your Data Center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Urgent: To make the transition to DevOps, we must build the tooling we'll all need to succeed. It’s become fashionable to say: “All the interesting technology problems in DevOps are solved. We have Docker. We have Kubernetes. We have OpenStack. They’re stable, and they’re widely deployed. All that’s left to do is process transformation, teaching dullard enterprise IT teams how to consume the new-new IT.” This is dangerous thinking. The DevOps transition is placing demands on the enterprise data center that will break infrastructure models and policies designed for a dying era of monolithic apps. If we don’t work together as a community to build a new generation of tooling for the DevOps era, performance won’t meet expectations, and then we’ll all get to read articles about how DevOps failed. We can fix this. This talk will examine three areas that need attention. If we work together, we can prepare for the fundamentally new infrastructure and process demands of DevOps.

The Infrastructure Behind the Curtain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As it turns out installing OpenStack isn't really the hard part any more.  Operating and maintaining OpenStack is much harder.  At IBM Blue Box we provide a managed private cloud solution.  This means that we run a large number of single tenant clouds and the infrastructure to operate and support many cloud deployments. We'll cover everything from how we can install OpenStack anywhere in the world with just a laptop (or a USB stick) with some inception level PXE booting, to how we provide secure access for operations to manage servers  ( bastion, ipmi, dashboards ), and how we perform monitoring and logging. Years of OpenStack operational experience and wisdom, distilled down into what you need to know about what really goes on behind the scenes to make cloud work.

The Juju/Ansible Bake-Off: Which Should I Choose To Deploy and Run my OpenStack?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Juju and Ansible are two highly popular means of deploying OpenStack, and they both standardize on the same core platform (Ubuntu). This makes them easy to compare fairly and impartially. In this presentation, we'll take a look at how they fare in a direct head-to-head. We'll look, in particular, at the following topics: What prerequisites exist for deploying OpenStack with Juju, and Ansible? How does an agentless and agent-driven approach compare? What does either tool offer for baremetal deployment? What architecture approach do the tools follow? What networking and storage options are available? How does either tool handle expansions/upgrades of the OpenStack environment? How can operators customize/override either tool's choices? How can operators switch from one tool to the other? This talk is free of bias toward either tool — my team and I have used both openstack-ansible and Juju to deploy OpenStack clouds in production, and have seen the pros and cons of either first-hand.

Toolkit Tips to Free DevOps Teams from Dependency Hell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Supporting different OpenStack environments can be difficult. From a DevOps perpective, how do you cope with different versions of the OpenStack client tools? Installing different versions of the client tools on the same host can easily end up in a dependency hell. Having the correct toolbox saves you and your team time and unnecessary work. Even better, having a tailor made set of tool at your dispose will make your work faster and your team more productive. We recognize that this is an issue for many stackers, including us, so we've decided to embrace the issue by building a toolkit that includes the most common pieces and parts used to operate, debug and develop an OpenStack cloud.

Unified Monitoring addressing Virtual Machines, Legacy Baremetal, Containers and Network Fabric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will talk about datacenter monitoring not only for openstack itself, but also for legacy baremeal, containters, physical and logical networks. These different types of resources really start co-related together with software defined techs. SK Telecom has been developing varios tools covering operation automation, monitoring and analytics, network visualization, seperately. However, we realized that these tools need to be integrated together. Therefore, we are building standarized pipeline of gathering all the information (leveraging monasca), and developing monitoring tool chains on top of the pipeline. We will share tools we are developing and our experience to work with operation team to partially realize our ideas. Active demo of tools, architecture, difficulties to leverage openstack technologies with our legacy datacenter will be presented as well. Lastly, we will share our envision to connect monitoring with automation to simplify complicated operation jobs in the datacenter.

Using a Cloud Management Platform for Day Two Openstack Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack currently uses Horizon as the GUI for cloud management. However, Horizon is not built with the enterprise users in mind. Organizations operating an OpenStack cloud have many needs that current OpenStack tooling doesn’t meet. This is where a true cloud management platform can help.By having a cloud management platform manage your OpenStack environment, you will be able to deal with the needs of an enterprise environment: approval workflow, compliance, self-service, chargeback, quota enforcement, resource management, capacity planning, optimization, configuration management, etc. In order to add all of these things on top of your OpenStack cloud, you need a cloud management platform.Red Hat CloudForms is a cloud management platform that offers unified management for hybrid environments, providing a consistent experience and functionality across container-based infrastructures, virtualization, and private and public cloud platforms.

Using OpenStack Infra to Benchmark Your OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Faced with the problem of measuring various  workloads we used OpenStack Infra. Few of these required a long running OpenStack deployment with constant workload resembling real world scenarios. Our initial focus was to attempt to emulate these workloads using a number of tools such as Tempest, Heat Stacks, Rally, User Stories, etc.It becomes difficult for any team, both small and large, to tackle this task and provide quality feedback without making this another project on its own.We thought why even simulate a workload when we can have a real thing? With Big Tent, OpenStack Infrastructure requirements for computing resources grows with every project or developer. That means they are in constant need of resources.In this talk we would like to present how we used OpenStack Infrastructure workload to measure API uptime and VM performance of our OpenStack deployments and helpedOpenStack community at the same time.

Utilizing an Application-Based Approach for Easier Deployment of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many approaches have been taken to enhance and simplify the deployment process for storage in OpenStack environments. One approach, from partners like Canonical, is to use an application and service modeling tool (Juju) to model, configure, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud, including OpenStack.

Will it run on *my* OpenStack?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Cloud Foundry ecosystem uses a tool called BOSH for packaging, installation, and updating workloads. Validating that BOSH can be used on an installation of OpenStack is currently a tedious and error-prone manual task. It's made harder by the fact that usually not a single team has expertise in both areas. Our team is building an open-source validation testsuite that encapsulates expert knowledge about the interaction of BOSH and OpenStack in a tool, which is easy to use for non-experts as well. It helps to find out if an OpenStack installation is ready to run BOSH, or which changes need to be done. The testsuite provides a DSL to express the requirements of a workload on OpenStack, which can be run as a set of validation tests, and gives feedback about required changes to the OpenStack setup. In this talk, we take a look how to express workload specific requirements in a simple series of tests, and report about the experience we gained with that in the Cloud Foundry project.

Zuul + Ironic: Automate you Lab as Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Zuul manges Openstack infrastructure workflows and OpenStack Ironic is baremetal service. In our team (100*X), we are deploying Zuul and using FusionSphere (Huawei OpenStack with baremetal service) as CI cloud in each lab or a group of racks.  In our labs, our business is testing FusionSphere (Huawei OpenStack) itself with different scenarios. It looks like community running its infrastructure on OpenStack public clouds, which means we are testing Cloud on Cloud. The difference or the challenge is that vm service is far from enough. We need strong baremetal service to run complex real deployment and mange devices other from physical servers, switches. And we have face more design points on baremetel cloud, such as affinity/anti-affinity, group provision ability etc. Currently, we don't have a 100% good sulotion yet, but we could share what we have thought about and current difficulties. Futher, those experiences are also helpful for the datacentor automation.

Achieving Hybrid/Multi-Cloud through Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hybrid cloud: as many definitions as there are solutions - and more hype than both combined. In the first part of this session we'll cut through the noise to understand the state of the market. Enterprise organizations have come to recognize that a hybrid cloud strategy is the likely answer and have begun the process of seeking out and implementing solutions. But what do these strategies consist of, and what are the solutions? We'll look at common definitions, objectives, and strategies for implementing hybrid cloud. In the second half of the session we'll present a technical architecture for one such solution, followed by a live demonstration. WAN automation allows for real-time provisioning of inter-cloud connectivity, and OpenStack provides a framework for integration and provisioning with public cloud service providers. The solution presented will bring together private and public clouds with the oft-requested single management interface.

Application Aware Root Cause Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Is application-aware RCA attainable? With the holistic system view of Vitrage you can drive application management using insights into application level faults.  Fault management in cloud systems is complex. With a mix of virtual & physical resources interacting, problems at one layer can have ripple effects throughout the system. One situation where this is most apparent is that of fault management in the context of app involvement.  Applications are comprised of virtual resources that may be distributed across separate OpenStack clusters, allowing for failures in one cluster to impact the performance of the other. This impact can be challenging to track in large production deployments. In this talk we present how Vitrage uses its latest Heat data source to give insights into application-level faults, and how Vitrage provides a clear and holistic view of the system, from physical infrastructure to virtual application, which can then be used to drive application management policy.

ATSDS – API Tracking and Selective Debugging System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operations biggest challenge is to quickly find the cause of the API failure without disruption. Openstack consists a mesh of services running on various nodes. If, an api fails, one has to find the error and then figure out the real cause. Since there are many services involved, it is challenging to pin point the cause of the issue. Typically, a person raises the logging level of services to DEBUG and then re-issue the API in question. This brings forth following challenges: User need to do this on each node where the service is active or shutdown the service on all nodes but one. Since logging level is increased to debugging at the service level there would be lot of logging data being pushed to log files. This proposal presents an architecture where users can track the API request flow through various services and enable logging for specific API requests, without modifying the configuration files and without restarting any services.

Automated path to Red Hat OpenStack Platform Certification? Yes, please.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A successful Openstack deployment is only possible if all layers of the system play well together, from the hardware all the way up to the cloud applications.All the components that make up OpenStack are thoroughly tested independently, but it is hard to know how they would end up behaving once put together.Red Hat provides a unique way for its partners to continuously test their setups with the latest snapshot of the Red Hat OpenStack Distribution.This approach has several benefits:  * Catch bugs as early as possible with a battery of tests.  * Extend the testing ecosystem beyond the Red Hat walls and into partner's environments.  * Make partners an integral part of the Red Hat OpenStack Distribution development cycle.  * Speed up the Red Hat OpenStack Certification process for partners.As a result of being part of this effort, if a partner has a passing CI when the engineering team decides to make the cut for the new release, their platform can be certified from day 1

Cisco Cloud Center Architecture with Openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack has demonstrated to be a solid platform to deploy cloud services, in public or private environments. By talking with SP or Cloud Providers, we have realized that their end users' workloads still require heterogeneous environments, MSFT, VMWare, Linux. Also, they need to interface to legacy systems: payment or OSS/BSS systems that are needed for ongoing operations. So, they need to have an upper layer of management and control that interfaces with theses systems but also is able to use Openstack to orchestrate underneath cloud-native applications.Cisco Cloud Center is an Application-driven policy orchestration engine that allows customers to deploy their applications in any public or private cloud. When Cloud Center is connected to Openstack, it provides a powerful solution for customers to transparently manage their applications from a service broker portal and use the power of Openstack underneath to automate these applications on the data center.

Hyper-Converged Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Red Hat Ceph Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation describes how to deploy Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Red Hat Ceph Storage in a way that both the OpenStack Nova Compute services and the Ceph Object Storage Daemon (OSD) services reside on the same node. A server which runs both compute and storage processes is also known as a hyper-converged node. There is increasing interest in the field for hyper-convergence for cloud (NFVi and Enterprise) deployments. The reasons include smaller initial deployment foot prints, a lower cost of entry, and maximized capacity utilization. The presentations covers the customization of TripleO and Ceph-Ansible to produce a completely automated hyper-converged deployment which supports adding new nova/osd servers, configuration updates and software upgrades. It also covers tunings made to the system in order to improve performance and isolate resources with NUMA. These tunings are then applied in an automated fashion using the same techniques covered in the configuration section.

Plethora of use cases with Openstack Storlets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Storlets enables to securely execute user-defined code near data residing in Openstack Swift. In this talk we introduce the project and demonstrate some real life use cases. Amongst the demonstrated use cases are: 1. Smart energy consumption services. Services, such as those offered by Gridpocket [1], rely on analytics over data collected from smart meters. Being highly sensitive data, storlets are used to preserve privacy by transforming the raw meters' data so that it can be made available to the energy analysis applications. 2.Efficient analytics over data in secondary storage. The amount of data (especially IoT data) being gathered for analytics is exponentially growing. Object storage is the typical choice for keeping such data sets. A critical question is whether these data sets, once there, can still be queried efficiently.With storlets we demonstrate up to X4 improvement when running SQL queries over CSV data kept in Openstack Swift.

Shift from Naive to Cloud Native: Integrating OpenShift and Kubernetes with OpenStack Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenShift, Red Hat’s Kubernetes-based Container Platform, can be deployed easily and ‘naively’ on top of OpenStack. You can simply run the OpenShift Ansible playbooks & have OpenShift up and running on OpenStack. However you will not be taking full advantage of ‘native’ OpenStack Resources such as Heat, Cinder, Swift, LBaaS, Designate, Neutron & more. If you are going to run OpenShift in production at scale, you’ll want to integrate more tightly with native OpenStack resources. In this deep dive technical session, we’ll demonstrate how to move from a simple overlay installation to a dynamic fully integrated deployment which makes the best possible use of OpenStack services. After this session, you will have learned practical deployment patterns based on Red Hat’s reference architecture for OpenShift on OpenStack. This will enable you to configure OpenShift on your OpenStack production infrastructure to meet and scale all your organization’s container-based needs.

Testing IBM Blue Box Cloud the OpenStack way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ursula is a collection of open source Ansible scripts that IBM uses to deploy its IBM Blue Box OpenStack clouds.  It comes with some basic multi-node OpenStack regression and integration tests that we have setup to run against every proposed change to the codebase.  The infrastructure services we use to accomplish this differ from upstream in almost every way, though. Where upstream uses Gerrit, we use GitHub.  Where upstream uses Zuul, we use Jenkins.  Where upstream uses Nodepool for multi-node provisioning, we use Heat.  So, what would it take to get these tests running the "OpenStack Way" (e.g. with nodepool and zuul) and what would the preceived benefits, drawbacks, and challenges be with this solution? This talk will attempt to answer these questions by walking through our evaluation with the hope it will prove educational both to prospective users of these infrastructure services and the people developing them.

What did we learn: The road of productize OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

More vendors starts to build commercial products based on OpenStack community releases, which is very good for OpenStack society. But it is not as easy as it sounds, in order to build commercial products on top of OpenStack, considering continues evolution, one should got involved deeply to the community, and thinking carefully about the product planning strategy, R&D process, HR structure and product release pace. Nevertheless, how to effectively synchronize OpenStack upstream and downstream product development, how to overcome the gap for QoS and sercurity standards between upstream and commercial products and how to fulfil customers requests that are ahead of OpenStack community's ability are also what vendors should care about. In this session, we will ilustrate the problems we meet in our way of building products based on OpenStack, share the lesson we learned and what we did to overcome them. Moreover, we will share the ideas and thinkings during our R&D process evolution.

Zero Admin OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Setting and operating OpenStack is hard and there are a few experts available on the market. With SolidFire and Platform9 it is possible to have a zero admin OpenStack. SolidFire is a storage which was built for OpenStack. It can be setup in Minutes without any expert skills and is fully managed by OpenStack. Platform9 introduces OpenStack as a SaaS offering. The entire OpenStack Control Plane is running in the cloud and is operated by Platform9. In the local datacenter a hostagent is installed on a plain Linux server. That hostagent talks to the Control plane and installs and runs all required modules like Nove, Cinder, Neutron, Glance locally on the servers in the onprem datacenter. With this approach it is possible to implement an entire OpenStack solution in the own datacenter without having Openstack skills. The Openstack environment is operated by Platform9 who are doing updates and support which eliminates the typical operational pain.

Project Updates
---------------


Achieving Zen-like Bliss With Glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Everyone uses Glance, but not everyone uses Glance. Uploading VM disks or data assets has always been the most commonly used feature of Glance. In this talk, we will explore features that extend beyond image upload -- features that operators can use to secure and improve the performance of their Glance deployment, as well as features operators can use to enable their end users toward better collaboration and discovery of data assets. In general, we will answer: How do I discover disk images ? How do I share images effectively with my organization ? How do I ensure the authenticity of image data using digital signatures ? How can I improve the performance of glance image uploads/downloads ? How can I make better use of my image metadata using property protections? What are image locations, and how can I tell if they’re appropriate for my cloud? And more..

Centralized Quota Management with Kingbird
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Multiple regions. Centralized Keystone. Fragmented quota management. Sounds familiar? Currently quotas are defined on a per-region basis. The fact that quotas are split accross Nova, Neutron and Cinder complicates things even further. All this makes it hard for operators to provide flexible resource allocation for users across regions. So what can we do about it? In this session we will show our approach to solving quota management in multiple regions, which is based on using the existing OpenStack APIs and doesn't require any modification of the existing compute, network and storage services. We will also introduce a new OpenStack project "Kingbird" that provides implementation of our ideas.

Chaos and Order: the user experience is king
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

An important aspect of enterprise ready is to enhance the user experience, CLI is the first channel for outside users interacting with OpenStack, that impact the user experience directly. Currently each service has offered thier own CLI application, but the project specific CLIs creates a horrible user experience for those trying to interact with the CLI as one have to continuously switching between different formatting, command structures, capabilities and requires a deep knowledge of which service is responsible for different tasks, this leads to high technical threshold and poor user experience. OpenStackClient project appears on the right path, it provide OpenStack users with a consistent, simple and predictable CLI user experience, reduce the complexity of OpenStack interaction. Topics discussed the issues encountered in OpenStack operation by using project specific CLI, as well as mission of OpenStackClient project, current ecological communities and the future plan.

Cinder-Nova API Interactions: The New Century
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nova and Cinder both belong to the core components of OpenStack and they are working and evolving closely together. Since the two modules are tightly coupled today, it highly affects both the interaction between their APIs and the possibilities to further enhance the features they can offer. The two teams started to work together on introducing some changes in order to improve the cooperation between the APIs and the coordination of the developers.During this panel we will discuss the shortcomings of the current architecture and interaction model between the two modules. We will highlight the upcoming changes in the Cinder API that will allow this component to be more standalone, while providing the avenue to introduce new functionality more easily. The panellists will also talk about the challenges in driving the changes between two large projects, and share the experiences of cross-project collaboration.

When using an OpenStack Cloud, users often need an extensible, flexible tool to manage resources (such as Nova servers, Heat stacks, Bare-metal servers, or Containers that comprise an application workload) as collections rather than individually. Operators often deploy telemetry toolkits to monitor the status of their resource pools. When certain pre-defined alarms triggered, operations are performed automatically or manually to remediate such situations. Operations concerning a cluster (group of resources) include the creation and updating of nova servers, provisioning or upgrading of software on specific nodes, detection and recovery of node failures, resizing the cluster based on certain measurements etc. The Senlin service fills this gap by providing a framework and APIs for users to execute custom actions on subsets of nodes or the whole cluster--like running operations by specific node types, executing shell scripts on specific nodes, or even running Ansible playbooks directly.

Enhanced platform awareness in OpenStack for mortals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has over a number of releases grown a large number of features that grant the compute scheduler enhanced visibility of the capabilities of the OpenStack environment and the hypervisors within it. These features when combined enable fine-grained matching of workloads with the capabilities of the platform that they require, sometimes referred to as Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA). Currently exposed capabilities include NUMA topologies, dedicated CPU cores, CPU thread policies, huge pages, SR-IOV physical functions, SR-IOV virtual functions, network interface cards, and other PCIe devices like GPUs. While these faciliies are already proving extremely useful for high performance computing (HPC), network function virtualization (NFV), and software defined networking (SDN) networking use cases the steps involved in requesting these capabilities for a virtual machine and the ways the features do and don't work in conjunction with each other are not always obvious.

Fuel Me Once Shame On You, Fuel Me Twice Shame On Me
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Users are incredibly ingenious when using a product in new and unexpected ways. OpenStack Fuel had to endure the rigors of deploying a large infrastructure like AT&T's.  As a critical part of the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC), the Fuel community was challenged to implement change based on new perspectives and functional requirements in order to meet the needs of enterprise large scale deployments. AIC provided a complexity unseen by developer community and added new use cases, architecture design, and network intricacies. As a result the Fuel project has grown and improved in leaps. Find out how AIC helped to advance the Fuel project to be a more resilient and flexible solution.

Glare - a unified binary repository for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Glare (from GLance Artifact REpository) is a new service in the Glance project that provides a secure and customizable unified binary repository for OpenStack. The idea behind Glare is to allow various OpenStack services to catalog different objects they use to operate. Images used by Nova to run the VMs are just the best known examples of such objects; other examples include Heat templates, Tacker blueprints, Murano packages, and so on. Obviously, this functionality is common for different kinds of objects, and is usually unrelated to the primary mission of respective projects using these objects. That's why we implemented a dedicated service that will take care of managing various data assets in OpenStack clouds. The talk will describe how Glare helps to manage different artifacts across the cloud, how you can build your own private and secure catalog with artifacts for your service, what deployers need to know about the installation process, and what is coming in the future.

High Availability for Pets and Hypervisors - State of The Nation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

By now, high availability for the OpenStack control plane is well understood, and to a large extent a solved problem which the community continues to refine. In stark contrast, most solutions for compute node HA (i.e. where VMs are automatically restarted on a different compute node if there is a failure in the hypervisor or its underlying hardware) are still either relatively young, or experimental, or in the design phase.  This is despite the high demand for this feature, which calls into question the older belief held by some that OpenStack should only accommodate "cattle" VMs which have resilience built in at the application layer. Since Tokyo, the OpenStack HA community and Product Working Group have been collaborating towards a unified upstream solution.  In this talk which follows on from the similarly named Austin talk, community members from Intel, NTT and SUSE summarise the status quo of the existing technology, future plans, and how anyone interested can get involved.

How Shadow Users is powering Federation in Keystone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Find out how Keystone is unifying identities and extending Federation to make Federated identities a first class citizen! Shadow Users is a new feature that unifies identities (LDAP, Federation…) and is powering Federation. Thus, all of Keystone identities are now stored in the database, allowing for referential integrity and improved performance, as well facilitating account linking. Meaning, that the new identity model allows a user to be associated to an LDAP identity and a Federated identity for example. And there is even more! Because of Shadow Users, Federated identities are now treated like any other identity and therefore, can receive concrete role assignments. This opens the door to a whole slew of features around Federation, such as automatically bootstrapping your users and projects through Federation. This talk will focus on the new features around unified identity and Federation, as well as upcoming features that will take Federated identities to the next level.


* **Ronald De Rose** *(Ron is an experienced software engineer at Intel, where much of his time have been focused on Identity & Access Management (IAM).  He is passionate about open-source software and has been an active contributor to the Keystone project.  Ron lives with his family in Arizona and enjoys playing basketball and tennis.)*

Mechanism Driver – Ironic deploying on VXLAN supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ironic project is young but important and fast-growing nowadays. Supporting VXLAN isolated tenant networks automated booting Baremetal server is the competitive point of all vendors. There are blueprints that support isolation tenant networks for above issue in Ironic side and Nova side [1] [2]. In Neutron side, the solution is based on Mechanism Driver – that is in possession of each vendor. I would like to propose Mechanism Driver with VXLAN isolated tenant network supported. The Mechanism Driver work with HW switch relied on OVSDB and JSON RPC communication. The Mechanism Driver acts as the OVSDB-client to remotely configure the OVSDB then builds networks on hardware (HW) Switch [3].   [1]: https://goo.gl/lCcd1z [2]: https://goo.gl/KpOvBf  [3]: https://goo.gl/LBCuoM

Native HTML5 consoles for VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The VMware driver in Nova has support for VNC consoles since the early days. However, cloud operators are facing multiple problems with deployment, scalability and security when providing VNC consoles to OpenStack instances running on the VMware stack. During the last three releases of OpenStack we have made several API changes in Nova which allow using the native protocol for VMware consoles and solve the previous hassles with VNC. In this presentation we will show how to deploy Nova with support for VMware consoles and the advantages compared to VNC.

OpenStack Requirements  : What we are doing, what to expect and whats next
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Syncing of requirements for OpenStack projects is a very important task since the way python package installation with pip works, this means that if you get lucky you'll end up with a working system. If you don't you can easily break all of OpenStack on a requirements update. Global requirements gives us a single place where we can evaluate these things so that we can make a global decision for OpenStack on the suitability of the library. The requirements team is trying hard to fulfil the REQUIREMENTS of managed projects with validating different requirements updates, auto-update of upper constraints for requirements to name a few tasks.

Present and Future of OpenStack Ironic Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Drivers are core components of Ironic. They define how Ironic interacts with hardware and ensure that different types of hardware can be represented by a consistent API. At the time of writing, Ironic has 24 production drivers in its source tree.It has become apparent that the way we compose and name drivers does not scale well. In the Newton release cycle we decided to completely rethink the notion of drivers in Ironic. This talk begins with the way drivers used to work in Ironic before the Newton cycle. It will then cover challenges we've faced with this schema. Finally, I will present the ideas and the results of the work known as Ironic driver composition reform. I will show how this change affects all of the interested parties: end users, operators and driver developers. I will also briefly cover the results of an effort to provide a 3rd party CI for all in-tree drivers.

Running virtual machines and system containers on a single compute host effectively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Since Kilo there is a new hypervisor type “parallels” in Nova brought up via libvirt. It was renamed to Virtuozzo in Liberty while its nova.conf parameter remains the same. Since Liberty there is a new Cinder volume driver called vzstorage. How do these two OpenStack components connect to each other and what benefits do they bring in addition to the most mature and widely used QEMU/KVM hypervisor? If you are interested in running via KVM not only Linux guests effectively but also Windows ones, if you are interested in creating elastic cloud where Virtual Machines can live side by side with System containers, if you are interested in live migration production quatily not only for virtual machines but also for containers, it will be worth visiting the presentaion. I will try to concentrate not on Virtuozzo product itself, but on improvements we are making regarding virtualization in opensource ecosystem in general and OpenStack in particular.

Security groups & Firewalls logging: How we capture and store security events in Neutron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will introduce a logging feature for security groups and firewalls [1][2] and show its benefit to operator and tenant. Today, logging becomes critical to ensure the enterprise has visibility into traffic entering and leaving the environment. Tracking DROP events is the good way to identify threat, logging ACCEPT events gives greater insight into malicious traffic. This session introduces a mechanism [2] to capture and store security events (ACCEPT/DROP) related to security groups and firewalls when they occur. We can collect security events for a specific VM, tenant, security group or firewall via Rest API or OSC. The log-data can be consumed by Monasca service or forwarded to external system to: Detect illegal communication Detect attack patterns and alert abnormal activities This feature also exposes a way to help tenant make sure security rules work as expected. This session includes a demo of the work in progress. [1] https://goo.gl/Cs7Koo [2] https://goo.gl/f2k52l

Serve hot objects fast and move iced ones to the fridge! Place your Objects based on it’s metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While object stores are predominantly used for archive, capabilities of multiprotocol access opens up newer use cases which require faster access to unstructured data. In SWIFT, with SwiftonFile open source modules which supports multiprotocol access, the object store sits over different tiers of storage pools that have different characteristics in terms of price/performance. Placing the right object at the right tier requires intelligent tiering of objects across the pools based on the object heat which is a direct reflection of it's access w.r.t time. Additionally, object store characteristic of having user defined metadata with objects can be used for tiering. With this, one can control tiering of objects based on object metadata, irrespective of when the metadata is updated.

Spanning your overlay network across clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the up-take of Hybrid Cloud, spanning the network across clouds is becoming a necessity. However, this capability is as-of-yet not supported by the cloud infrastructure. Moreover, OpenStack networking is designed as a “single network domain”, lacking the model to define a network that crosses the cloud boundary. In a Hybrid Cloud environment, you want to be able to define a virtual network that connects your virtual machines, regardless of their network domain. In this session, we will present a solution and reference design that enables OpenStack to connect multiple remote networks, allowing users to establish Virtual Network connections between VMs across different clouds.

The Challenge and Solution for Glance Image Copy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In Cloud senario, users uses the same image or images with particular content for the most of the time, sharing and backup will be a common user demand, this needs Glance to be able to provide the ability of copy images. From v1 API to v2 API, Glance have provided this kind of ability in various ways: copy-from, location-add and task-import, all of them have problems more or less, which lead to very bad user experiance of image copy, and Glance service could be unusable in the worst case senario. The Glance team is already aware about this and is trying to provide better functionality through refactor of the provided functionalities. This topic will introduce and discuss how image copy can be done with the current Glance implementation and what are the limitations and cons for each method, what will be modified to provide better user experiences.

Through the Looking Glass: Unifying Image Generation in OpenStack Sahara
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Sahara users can now drive image packing, image validation, and clean image provisioning from one human-readable, yaml-based image declaration. This feature may be of interest to operators (who build images) and to developers (who may wish to consider the ideas for reuse.) Many provisioning services in OpenStack spawn their applications from pre-packed images. In plugin-based services like Sahara, the plugin must be responsible for image validation and for logic to spawn a cluster from a clean, OS-only image. However, elements used in traditional OpenStack image generation are not easily usable by the controller services. The OpenStack Sahara team has pushed all image generation logic into the plugin and created tooling (using libguestfs’ python API) to run the same logic before Nova spawn (on an image file) or after (on a running instance.) Now when operators change the human-readable manifest, all three flows are updated and cannot fall out of sync.

Understanding Keystone Federation using K2K
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Let’s take a deep dive K2K federation to learn more about keystone’s federation support. Keystone2Keystone federation is a feature of keystone that allows keystone to be run as both an identity provider and a service provider in a federation. First introduced in the Juno release it has been updated and improved in all releases since. K2K allows us to experiment with keystone’s federation support without having to mess with overly complicated identity providers. This talk will dive deep into the technical details of setting up a small K2K federation using the Mitaka release. Most of the setup will be done through the command-line interface. We’ll be discussing each command and its significance as we go. We’ll also be configuring non-OpenStack software, like Apache. Along the way you’ll hear about core federation concepts, like mapping, and how they may apply to federating to external identity providers.

Achieving end-to-end compliance based on hardware root of trust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Study shows that security is still the biggest barrier to cloud adoption, with compliance and data protection being top concerns for a CISO.    Enterprises often have a need to enforce policies (based on data sovereignty requirements) such as virtual workloads should only be placed, or migrated, based on location and assurance of hardware platform. Some others want to launch VMs/Apps/Containers on Servers with Boot Integrity – Platform Trust, while some have a need to extend the chain of trust from platform to workload (VM/Container). This session features a demo along with a reference architecture that shows end-to-end compliance (boot time to shutdown) using hardware and software attestations, as well as continuous compliance monitoring for drifts in an OpenStack cloud.

Automatic Secured Application Deployment in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud services by allowing mutualizing infrastructure makes them an attractive target for malicious users. It also creates new attack vectors between tenants. Most cloud providers offer default security policies that do not always fit tenants custom security needs. IQ-Orchestra is a user-centric approach proposing automatic deployment and securing of complex distributed applications on Cloud platforms. From a user-friendly high-level description of the application and its security requirements, IQ-Orchestra automatically computes security configurations according to best pratices and standards then orchestrates the deployment of the secured application in Openstack. During this talk, there will be a demonstration of a secured deployment with IQ-Orchestra on top of RDO illustrating the mitigation of top threats.

Bringing L7 Security to Kubernetes with OpenStack Kuryr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We demo a solution for bringing L7 security to Kubernetes (K8s). Openstack Kuryr's new K8s components enable the placement of Pods on Neutron-managed networks, in turn enabling Neutron's service-chaining to redirect traffic to security Pods for inspection. The Neutron topology is inferred by Kuryr's K8s API Watcher from standard K8s models. We are proposing a small extension to K8s' new Network Policy template to map workloads to externally defined and named security policies. Our design leverages Kuryr's new CNI Driver and API Watcher "Raven", MidoNet Neutron Plugin, Forcepoint Containerized Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Intel Open Security Controller (OSC) as service orchestrator. In our demo: 1) An admin defines a DPI policy for traffic between Pods matched by label keys and values 2) OSC deploys a preconfigured containerized NGFW 3) OSC calls Neutron APIs to redirect appropriate packets into the NGFW 4) Layer 7 attacks are then blocked by the NGFW

Evolution of Open Security Controller: Effectively orchestrating multiple security functions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most large enterprises enable security in their data centers by deploying multiple VNFs from different vendors to ensure that a broad range of security threats are covered. For example they will deploy vIPS, vNGFW and vADCs and enterprise operations teams face a constant challenge to manage this broad portfolio of security services and define a service function chain that ensures data center resources are protected and always up to date. The Open Security Controller has evolved over the past few months to tackle this very challenge and simplifies the task of managing security by providing a single plane of glass to orchestrate multiple security services within Openstack. In this session we will describe and demonstrate how the Open Security Controller can orchestrate multiple security services and enable security service function chaining based on the defined policy.

Fortifying OpenStack Clouds Against Security Breaches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Security has become a global issue and as cloud deployments rise, security is a critical consideration in architecting and building clouds. In 2015, a zero-day vulnerability was uncovered every week and more than half a billion personal records were stolen or lost. Security admins are no longer asking “if” there will be a breach, but “when” and how to contain a breach from spreading or accessing the entire data center. The traditional model of perimeter security with firewalls is no longer sufficient to protect data centers and additional measures that not only prevent attacks but contain and neutralize attacks must be taken. With OpenStack, there are a number of options available from networking layer all the way to the application layer.

Hardening Security Inside Out for OpenStack Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Security is changing rapidly as attacks evolve beyond DDoS, brute force, browser, or shellshock type methods. While firewalls and perimeter based designs are standard practice, new security approaches are emerging as virtualization and cloud become prevalent and provide additional layers of security that may not be available previously. From preventative to active security techniques, OpenStack operators have the opportunity to secure north-south and east-west traffic not only from bare metal machines, but virtual machines and containers on a per tenant basis with hardened OS, active insertion of firewalls anywhere in virtual topologies to monitoring security by using policy-based virtual TAP and advanced GUI views. In this session, speakers will discuss how security models are changing with the onset of virtualization and cloud, and what tools are available for OpenStack operators to bolster their security.

Hide&Seek - Aggressive OpenStack security for operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a rich framework that offers lots of options in configuration, architecture and technology backends. With it, there is a lenghty list of vulnerabilities and common but unhealthy practices that can be exploited. Aggressive security defense means to not only secure our environment following the standard system administration guidelines for security, but also employ penetration tools to enhance our environment defenses. OpenStack does offer an array of tactics, projects and settings that can help us reduce existing vulnerabilities, provide forensic data and limit exploit damage.

Holistic security for OpenStack clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nothing clears out a conference room faster than a discussion around information security. Securing complex computer systems, such as OpenStack clouds, is extremely difficult. To make matters worse, attackers can make many mistakes without consequences. A defender’s single mistake could lead to a breach. Don't let fear rule the discussion around security. Operators need a simple and scalable method for securing OpenStack clouds. That starts with grouping components into compartments and then looking at how those compartments interact with each other. Those interactions form the backbone of security policies and technical controls. In this vendor-neutral talk, Major Hayden, principal architect at Rackspace, will break down the complexity of securing OpenStack clouds using real-world scenarios. Attendees will learn how to: Divide OpenStack deployments into compartments Analyze the interactions between each component Develop security policies and apply technical controls

How to futureproof your OpenStack Deployment to ensure compliance with GDPR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

General Data Protection Regulation is here and it is law so come 25th of May 2018 you better have your things in order or it will hurt you pretty hard. There are severe penalties for breaking GDPR, 4% of your global turnover. You are affected even if your company outside the EU as long as you do business with EU citizens. Cloud is the magic bullet to solving your compliance issues but you need to run it correct to avoid the chopping block. We will look through OpenStack configurations and policies and have a look at what need to be done and what need to be changed. We will have a discussion what Privacy by Design means in terms of OpenStack. What can be done within OpenStack itself and what are appropriate step to take with other tools. How to set up a compliant architecture. All base on real case law. With this session we hope to bring GDPR from the lawyers and in to the datacenter. It is not just a legal discussion where it usually stops but most certainly a technical one as well.

But real work and not just a lot of complinace and regulations but something that is acctually for the betterment of mankind.  Unfortunately I happen to bee good at security, especially social engineering, and now I am stuck. But I am happy to share my knowledge and experience in making thins both secure and compliant. And no they are not alwas the same thing.  Compliance is solved through the cloud. Epecially smarter clouds. OpenStack is the key to this. OpenStack is 42 to compliance. One stack to forever in the darkness bind them.  )*


How to make legacy systems compliant without needing to change them by using smarter clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Regulatory agencies are launching new regulations and directives at a great pace. GDPR, NIS, Basel, Solvency are just a few that the EU are spitting out. The challenges are that how do you take the regulations and the laws and translate them into technical demands and solutions. Then how do you make your legacy systems that run as an internal organ in your organization compliant with modern standard. Often rebuilding them would be the equivalent of open heart surgery.  The solution is a smarter cloud. By utilizing the new features OpenStack has to offer you can keep your legacy systems and still be compliant.  We will take out important demands from all the regulations and map them against standards like ISO270xx. Then we will show you a high level architecture that is compliant for Internet banking within the EU. That standard will be good enough for most other applications as well. We will look at both tech and processes that are required.

Identity in Tripleo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting a security-hardened OpenStack deployment is a daunting challenge. You want to integrate your TripleO deployment into your organization's existing security management toolchain. You already have a way to manage your X509 certificates for network transport layer security. You already store your user database and may expose it via LDAP and Kerberos or federate it via SAML. TripleO has a complex deployment process that is daunting to the neophyte. However, once you understand the mechanics, you can customize your TripleO deployment in many ways. You’ll also be able to security-harden your TripleO deployment with industry-standard encryption.

Improving cloud trust with the TPM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most of what you've heard about the TPM is all about measurement and the difficulty of connecting it to cloud applicatons.  However, this talk won't talk about this.  Instead I'd like to concentrate on a couple of use cases where we can improve cloud trust by using the TPM.  Besides measurement, TPMs can manage and escrow secret keys (escrow means you can load a key into the TPM in a way it can never be extracted) and bind and seal secrets.  Some of the most significant cloud trust problems are how you load your keys and secrets into a cloud application in such a way that a hacker can't seal them.  This talk will present a practical use case for this for VPNaaS, which is likely to be the foundation for hybrid cloud.  We'll also discuss some of the limitations, like an escrowed key can only be uploaded to a single known TPM, which is tied to a physical system, so cloud use of the TPM presents placement and migration problems for cloud orchestration systems.

Incorporating BSIMM for OpenStack Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Security is evolving slower than its components.  Especially OpenStack software need to be robust even when it is under attack. This calls for all organizations, groups and individuals agreeing on a common ground on OpenStack software security.  BSIMM fits that bill.  As BSIMM is measuring stick for software security, it will give OpenStack developers, users, IT managers and executives a non-subjective determination of where each component of OpenStack component stand individually and collectively. As most of the leading cloud and software companies are adoping BSIMM as a measuring stick for security, OpenStack development, deployment and management community will benefit in adoping BSIMM.  As BSIMM has evolved since late nineties and in its sixth major version with data from 78 leading firms, OpenStack community can leverage this collective work that is already done.

Key management infrastructure in OpenStack-based Cloud/NFV deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Encryption is the foundation of OpenStack environment for enterprises moving sensitive workloads to the cloud.  Keys are used for authentication and cryptography, but can become the weakest link in securing the workload, if not well secured.  HSM (Hardware Security Module) solutions can protect the Keys in traditional environments, but are not suitable in Multi-Cloud environment, as enterprises expect to control Keys, even if the workloads are running in various clouds.  Network HSM (appliance-based HSM) come to address Key security in Cloud environments.  Secure Key Management technology for Cloud deployments go beyond network HSM, addressing not only Key security, but also high-performance secure crypto execution, by keeping the Keys in a central vault, and distributing the cryptography execution closer to the workload applications.  This session proposes an architecture for secure Key management in OpenStack-based NFV/Cloud deployments.

Leverage Ironic to secure bare metal service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Bare metal services in an OpenStack environment is traditionally not secure due to gaps in boot methodologies and mode of boot. Shared resources could expose unintended data breaches. Legacy boot of bare metal servers is unsecure due to possibility of altering of boot-time drivers. This unscrupulous activity could expose users to hacks and breaches. Bare metal service is exposed for exploitation due to the unsecure characteristics of PXE boot environment. Other aspect We explore how to secure it for enterprises using Ironic. Traditionally when a tenant is un-provisioned there are manual steps to make sure user data is scrubbed before allocating the same set of resources to another user/tenant. If these manual steps are not followed properly we could expose one user’s data to another leading to data breaches. Session will talk on how to offer bare metal as a service in secure and reliable manner for enterprise grade deployments. UCS policy framework will address each of these issues.

MineMeld: An Open Source Threat Intelligence Framework for Protecting your Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Threat intelligence(TI) programs are increasingly becoming part of a robust network defense strategy to protect your cloud. Threat intelligence provides the ability to recognize and act upon indicators of advanced targeted attacks and compromise. Operationalizing and incorporating threat intelligence information into your OpenStack security infrastructure remains a challenge due to its availability via multiple information sources (open source, commercial et al), formats and lack of universal translation mechanism that can be understood by security policy enforcement points (firewalls et al). MineMeld is an open sourced extensible threat intelligence processing framework that provides organizations the ability to ingest information about various indicators from multiple sources, aggregate them and deliver them in a standardized format.

Non-public public cloud with confidence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Companies increasingly look at public clouds also to process highly confidential data. To facilitate this, public cloud providers need to invest into solid security protection. Security specifications in an isolated private environment are a challenge. For a public accessible environment they are a nightmare. In this session we will address security topics from the perspective of public cloud providers. After starting with common & best practices, like the importance of a central logging with a good set of queries and the use of VPNs to access internal networks & applications without exposure to public networks, we will have a look on security tools and frameworks, inside and outside the OpenStack ecosystem. Documentation, business processes and education are other important topics that need to be revisited in the context of security. The presentation will give a look behind the scenes of Open Telekom Cloud (an OpenStack based public cloud) with respect to those security aspects.

OpenStack Compliance the DevOps Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Chances are if you run an OpenStack cloud, you have some form of compliance you have to adhere to. It may be some internal CIO driven compliance written in 1993, or external compliance requirements like HIPPA or PCI. We'll show you how Blue Box Cloud manages its compliance by utilizing the power of DevOps and open source software to not only enforce (Ansible) our adherence to compliance but to actively monitor and alert (Serverspec, Sensu, ELK) the moment a server falls out of compliance. Of course this is not a magic wand that will make your systems PCI compliant, the underlying operating system and software need to have the appropriate features to support the compliance requirements. For example, we are not injecting any magic to perform automated password rotation in keystone (that would need to be solved in keystone itself, or custom middleware) but rather enabling or configuring the keystone options to do so.

OpenStack Hardening With TripleO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

TripleO makes OpenStack deployments easier, but for security-conscious admins, architects and engineers, TripleO presents another layer of complexity. How do you migrate from shell scripts and Puppet manifests to a TripleO-friendly deployment? In this session, we'll show you how to make TripleO an asset instead of an obstacle, and how to harden your controllers and compute nodes from the OS to all layers of the stack.

OpenStack PKI is basically magic. Here’s some spells to get you started.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack clouds tend not to fit into traditional security architectures.  After all, the primary purpose of a cloud is to take external workloads and data and position them deep within your data center.   Any OpenStack cloud will be a composition of many interacting and optional services. These services often bridge security domains and networks. Over the last few releases, developers have worked hard to ensure that deployers have the option to secure individual connections between services with Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However,  this has left how to manage PKI, the fundamental system of certificates underpinning TLS as an exercise for the cloud operator.   In this presentation we guide the audience through a number of considerations and approaches to securing a cloud with PKI before exploring some specific reference architectures that we have created to make secure deployment easier for everyone.

PCI via Federation and Keystone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) define industry security standards around monetary transactions, specifically the handling of credit card data. There are many Identity Providers that are compliant with these security standards, and one can use Federation with Keystone to be PCI compliant. Within Keystone, you will find that we have added new PCI features in Newton. With the goal to eventually have OpenStack be PCI compliant out-of-the-box! Why is PCI DSS important?  All major credit card companies require services that process and/or store credit card data to meet PCI DSS security requirements.  Thus, if you are doing business in the cloud, you will have to meet these requirements. In this talk we shall discuss how to offload the burden of compliance with PCI DSS standards to other Identity Providers, what to do with existing user directories and how to accept the burden and still be compliant.

Project-Independent Key Management using Open Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack continues to mature with an increasing number of security features that have the need to store secrets (e.g., encryption keys). Applying best practices for key management is a critical aspect of security. Unfortunately, the Barbican project for key management has not been widely adopted. The latest OpenStack user survey from April 2016 indicates just 2% of production deployments include Barbican. In this presentation, we introduce Castellan, a key management interface that takes the pain out of key management. We demonstrate Castellan’s seamless interoperability with Barbican and appliances that support the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) standard. KMIP is an OASIS standard for key management that is already widely used within industry. Its support in OpenStack facilitates the inclusion of existing, hardened vendor solutions for key management as has been adopted by other commercial cloud providers.

Recon security audit tool in OpenStack deployment and operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

HPE security released the Recon tool for system audit and hardening.I'd like to show what are the good ways to apply it in cloud deployments.Specifically, why is it useful for spot checks on existing systems and for repeated tests in the QA pipeline, and why is it useful on virtualisation hosts and guests.This also explains why is it useful to talk about Recon in context of Openstack deployment and operation.I'll talk about why did we write a new tool and how does it compare to existing, known projects.I'll also show what does/doesn't Recon do compared to other security tools like rootkit hunters, integrity scanners, vulnerability scanners - and how can they integrate.

Scope in the token - A fire in the RBAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Current OpenStack API protection model provides several ways to controll user access to different API's. However, only the default one is widely used and at least barely known. There are several not so obvious options to set up secure environments with flexible access control: - oslo.policy provides an interface to plug third-party application (such as Apache Fortress)  in and even store and operate policies dynamically - another approach is to handle separation of duties and enforce policies internally in keystone - no more scoped tokens. This one is under active discussion - your opinion is invaluable! Logically, provided keystone becomes a manager of service policies, it has everything to enforce API protection without the need to issue, pass and, consequently - validate authorization information (AKA 'token scope'). That, in turn, means OpenStack doesn't require tokens to operate! Let's discuss!

Secure application deployment in the age of continuous delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditionally, when datacentre operators talk about application security, there has been a tendency to focus on issues related to key management, firewalls and data access. By contrast, application developers have a security focus which is more aligned with code analysis and fuzzing techniques. The reality is, secure application deployment principles extend from the infrastructure layer through the application and include how the application is deployed. With the prevalence of continuous deployment, it’s imperative to focus efforts on what attackers’ view as vulnerable; particularly in an environment where new exploits are being disclosed almost daily. In this session we’ll present: How known vulnerabilities can make their way into production deployments How exploit impact is maximized through knowledge gaps A methodology for ensuring deployment of vulnerable code can be minimized A methodology to minimize the potential for vulnerable code to be redistributed

Securing Intra-Cloud via Distributed Security - Contain, Block, and Neutralize Attacks Anywhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While firewalls are effectively deployed for perimeter security across different cloud networks, the problem remains for securing traffic inside a cloud with multiple tenants. One way to address this is via distributed virtual security with policies that protect north-south and east-west traffic within a cloud. With overlay topologies, distributed virtual firewalls can be deployed in multi-tenant networks. With distributed virtual firewalls, operators can distribute, automate actions such as contain, block, redirect to neutralize attacks by bringing up firewall instances anywhere in a cloud. Topics will include:      Holistic solution approach: Multi-vendor Integration to deliver solutions faster        Securing north-south and east-west traffic      Role of overlay networks and micro-segmentation      Virtual security policies and distributed virtual firewalls      Deployment scenarios such as securing 3-tier applications      Demo of virtual distributed security

Securing Microservices in OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As microservices grow, traditional firewall rules based on network ACLs are no longer scalable and fall short of providing fine-grained enforcement. Group Based Policy (GBP) is a flexible policy language that allows users to specify policy enforcement based on intent, independent of network infrastructure and IP addressing. Using micro-segmented virtual domains, administrators can define policies at a centralized location and use IO Visor technology for distributed enforcement. This provides infrastructure independent rules, template-based policy definitions, and scale-out policy enforcement for a solution that secures and scales with microservices.   The discussion will also cover using GBP for Cloud Foundry application spaces where microservices are deployed and need scalable, efficient security policies.

Security Group for Baremetal - How to ensure more safety and performance for baremetal servers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session explains security group feature without performance degradation for baremetal servers. Currently Ironic and Neutron are working on implementation of multi-tenant network for baremetal servers. Having implemented the feature, tenant network for baremetals can be isolated each other in the same way as VMs. However there is a critical gap between baremetals and VMs in terms of security area in production environment. Baremetals does not have L2 layer security feature same as security group for VMs, that is to say baremetal cannot filter packets which sent from same subnet. Therefore, we propose security group implementation without performance degradation for baremetal servers.

Security on OpenStack: Best practices from Hypervisor to Tenant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you deploy OpenStack in an enterprise as a private cloud, the deployment is usually behind a firewall and inside the trusted network with existing systems. However, when you deploy OpenStack in as public facing cloud, no assumptions can be made regarding the trust level of the domains, and the list of attack vectors increases significantly. Such attacks might result in loss of data, functionality, and reputation. In this presentation we will discuss security best practices that should be applied to each and every OpenStack cloud, public or private. We will start you off with best practices that will help you secure your Hypervisors, and show you how to enforce security across tenants by creating and enforcing policies.

Security Service Insertion and Security functions Orchestration without a SDN controller.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Inserting security functions like Next Gen firewalls in OpenStack requires service insertion capabilities which can be addressed either by SDN controllers natively or by using Networking SFC that is currently being developed. In this session we will discuss how the Open Security Controller uses a modular plug-in based approach for security service insertion. We will articulate what we see as gaps in OpenStack that need to be addressed in order to enable automated security service insertion without a SDN controller. Additionally we will demonstrate an approach we have used as a workaround and discuss how we plan to integrate with a fully functional networking SFC as it evolves.

Security-Aware Scheduling - Extensible security attribute management in Nova
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scheduling workloads based on Trust Attestation of hosts, Asset Tag/geo-tags stored on hosts, and other security attributes such as presence of security accelerators, etc  today requires calling into an external service to retrieve the host attributes.  This has serious consequences for performance and scale.  How can host security attributes be used for scheduling, securely and without impacting scalability or scheduling performance?   This session will detail the Intel Attestation Reporting Hub, which uses an extensible framework to securely push cryptographically verifiable host attestation attributes to the openstack scheduler, rather than letting the scheduler request attestations.  This works in conjunction with modifications to OpenStack Nova, which create new interfaces to receive secured host attributes from a trusted external source, and an updated Trust Filter, which uses the new local attributes for scheduling instead of making external requests.

Session Title  Managing secrets securely using Barbican and multiple Hardware Security Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Security needs vary from one enterprise to the other, and from one type of workload (Dev/QA, production and compliant) to another, based on the risk profile and compliance requirements.  Managing secrets (passwords, keys, tokens and certs) is critical to proactively protect against data thefts and other types of attacks, meet regulatory compliance and scalability needs.   Enterprises need multiple back end key managers or HSMs to manage secrets for various types of workloads with different security needs.  Upstream Barbican project addresses this use case by providing the capability to configure and manage secrets using multiple HSMs through its plugin mechanisms.During this track we will provide an overview of various security use cases  to manage secrets, along with a reference architecture and demonstration to manage secrets (keys used for encrypting Cinder block storage data  and LBaaS certs) using multiple types of key managers (PKCS#11 and KMIP compliant).

Simple, Scalable, and Secure OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data is no longer confined to discrete physical servers in bunker-like data centers. With OpenStack,VMs containing sensitive data can reside on any number of physical hosts in any number of physical locations. This presents an issue, as many customers, e.g. financial or healthcare institutions, are bound by government regulations to prove that sensitive data is kept within specific geographic boundaries, and that the host running the VM is uncompromised. We’ll show how you can quickly and easily create, deploy and scale an OpenStack environment using Fuel plugins and Intel’s CIT (Cloud Integrity Technology) to establish and maintain hardware trust, and Citrix’ XenServer hypervisor to provide a verifiable host environment. Attendees will learn how hardware trust and hypervisor functionalities interlock to provide reliable security and automated policy compliance in OpenStack, and understand a toolkit for configuring, deploying and scaling trust-enabled clouds with speed and efficiency.

Simplifying Security Orchestration for  Multi-Vendor OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Security is often deployed as multiple VNFs such as virtual firewalls, IPS, DPI, etc. in OpenStack clouds. A key challenge for OpenStack operators is to deploy and manage a broad portfolio of security services for virtual machines and containers to ensure data center resources are protected and always up to date. Simplifying the task of security orchestration is key and helps operators meet compliance. A multi-vendor security orchestrator to manage security services from a single pane of glass simplifies the task of managing security. Join this panel for the latest state of security, challenges, security use cases, architectures, and open source options for collaboration/community updates. Topics include: Use cases, challenges of deploying security at rate of cloud (1000s of VMs & containers) Requirements and approaches of orchestrating security   Service insertion, function chaining and impact to security

Smart Orchestration –Trusted Docker Containers with Kubernetes and Intel Cloud Integrity Technology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

App Containers are very effective way to deploy applications abstracted from the underlying infrastructure. Kubernetes is one of the key container orchestration/cluster management software of choice. Security is concern with container technology, and many app container developers have key questions like:  “Are my approved and curated set of container images launched?”,  “Are my containers running on secure servers” “How can Kubernetes use platform (Host and Docker Engine) Integrity verification while scheduling my containers"                                                                                              If these questions are interesting and relevant for your work, than this session is for you.  The session will provide a Solution Architecture (and a Live demonstration) of how to integrate platform integrity assurance and  container image integrity with Kubernetes.

Title: Container Defense in Depth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Defense in depth is an information assurance technique used to protect a system from any particular attack - use of blended countermeasures, working together to meet control and governance requirements. In a containerized world, defense in depth is applied by thinking about security within a container, on the container host and at the container platform layer. This talk will cover numerous technologies and practices at each layer - from kernel quality, SELinux (svirt), SECCOMP, and use of root, to measuring attack surface, patch remediation, and platform level authentication/authorization, these are the droids you are looking for. This talk will help an end user understand the breadth of tooling that is available at each level and how they will help protect their system from intrusions and compromises.

Trust-based delivery of sensitive material to a Virtual Machine or Docker Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you ever wondered how to validate that that a VM or the container being launched is trusted and secure before you push secrets and sensitive content to it?   Not only that, what if we can bind secrets so that they are only accessible on the specific server on which the container is running?   This turns out to be one of the key pain points and requirements for container developers.  This can be done today using Intel TXT, Intel Cloud Integrity Technology and TPMs on hardware. In this session Intel and IBM Security Architects will walk through the solution architecture with OpenStack and CloudFoundry and demonstrate how it is possible to:  Verify the integrity of the Docker platform on which the container image is being launched Verify the integrity of the container images being launched Release the secrets and keys based on the verification of this integrity Wrap the keys/secrets with the host platform TPM binding key so only that platform can release the keys/secrets

Using Existing Security Features for End-to-End Confidentiality and Integrity in the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A recent survey by the Cloud Security Alliance indicated that cloud security is an executive- or board-level concern for 61% of companies [1]. Despite this concern, a significant number of security features are currently available in OpenStack and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data across its services. This presentation starts with a short primer on information assurance (IA) and illustrates how OpenStack’s existing security features address common security concerns. In particular, we provide an overview of key management, image signing and encryption, block storage encryption, and object storage encryption. We show how these features individually and collectively secure data in OpenStack. This presentation concludes with an overview of ongoing efforts to add new security features and remaining gaps that should be addressed.

'Stacked Storage with Ceph at CERN: Glance, Cinder, ... Manila?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

CERN IT has been operating Cinder and Glance services, backed by Ceph, for close to three years. The technologies involved have demonstrated their flexibility when building higher-level IT applications (we now host more than 2200 Cinder volumes). So the obvious question is... what's next? On the one hand, both the growth and age of these services has required us to refresh the hardware behind our largest Ceph cluster. We'll present how we transparently doubled of largest Ceph cluster to six petabytes. On the other hand, we have recently started evaluating CephFS for HPC use-cases. Though it's still early days, the initial feedback from users has been positive, and we've therefore wondered: if our CephFS/HPC tests are successful and we decide to open it as a wider service, then could OpenStack Manila help use manage a large, multi-user CephFS system?

50PB Multi-site Cloud Object Storage in China Mobile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

    The cloud storage is becoming the most important part of IaaS platform, because internet and mobile internet produced a mass of video, image and some other unstructured data. Therefore, ChinaMobile built 50PB cloud storage service for enterprise and individual customer this year.      There are some challenges in this program: one is the scale of storage service, it contains more than 1000 servers totally, we haven't found too much successfull cases; the other one is the unified namespace that crossed multi-site. We did sufficient investigation and research, including Ceph, Swift and some other options.      Finally, We decided to build and operate 50PB Object Storage service based on Ceph. The object storage service has also been integrated with our OpenStack-powered cloud platform to store the backups of virtual machines and glance images. We use the new multi-site architecture of ceph to meet the needs of scale and erasure code to reduce the total cost.

Accelerating Ceph with NVMe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Solid state storage is increasingly an important technology for significantly increasing IOPS and reducing latency. Unfortunately, legacy industry standard drive interfaces are unable to keep up with this demand for high IOPS and low latency. NVM Express (NVMe) technology helps eliminate those barriers and deliver end-to-end performance gains. This session will present an architecture using NVMe devices for Ceph block storage applications. Benchmark results comparing NVMe to traditional storage approaches will be presented. This session will also discuss the upcoming Ceph storage backend BlueStore, and present a conceptual architecture for using NVMe together with BlueStore.

Adventures in exploring containers : Using, Cloudfuse to get Swift as Docker volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

During one of our explorations into containerized infrastructure challenges, we found that we needed a cheap solution to store terabytes of artifact. As an Openstack-certified provider, we're very keen on using Swift as the storage back-end for Artifactory, our artefact management system, but weren't satisfied with buying a $30k/ year driver for it. So we experimented with ways to configure and scale Cloudfuse, a Linux OS level driver for Swift. In this presentation, Sébastien Delisle and Corentin Ardeois will share their journey into containers, artifact management, kernel security with docker, and a concrete Cloudfuse use-case.

Applying Flash to a Parallel Fileystem in support of Openstack Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Whilst a scalable parallel filesystem brings some interesting benefits in building a storage layer for Openstack environments, architecting Openstack on parallel filesystems is performed today largely in the absence of quality data. A single, highly scalable namespace for object, cinder, glance and mounted, shared filesystems is possible today with Spectrum Scale (previously GPFS) and can reduce the complexity of openstack environments and provide a useful path from traditional research environments into virtualised ones. However, today it is difficult, a-priori for an architect to understand the implications of running production services at scale on the IO loads placed upon the underlying filesystem and storage - in particular when using a parallel filesystem. Further to this, whether or not to deploy higher–cost flash tiers, and if so, how, and at what capacity complicates the architect's task. We provide benchmark data at scale to improve the current state of understanding.

Beyond Object Storage - A Unified storage Architecture for IoT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the immense growth of connected devices across multiple industry verticals in recent times, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms gained huge focus across various organisations. As volume, velocity of data generated by the IoT devices are massive, there exists a need for scalable, faster, analytic, internet friendly storage. Even though we are in early stages of IoT wave there exists multiple frameworks (centralized vs. decentalized), prototypes in market today. However with the maturity of IoT workloads, openstack swift architecture as a sole does not meet the growing requirements of IoT data. The proposed presentation discusses in detail various design issues and nuances associated with object storage serving IoT workload and presents different features, approaches to solve them by leveraging a massively scalable, parallel, n unified clustered file and object storage architecture.

Block, Object, NFS, SMB in a single region storage cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You are asked to design and deploy an OpenStack private cloud. The requirements are straightforward: roughly 20-30 compute nodes, 100 cores and flat DHCP networking in a single region. However, you are expected to support a variety of storage protocols: block for database, object for images and videos, NFS and SMB for file shares. On top of that, service availability and reliability are critical. There are several architectural approaches to in designing a storage cluster, using Ceph, Swift, or unified block storage, but what are the pros and cons and what are the trade off's between performance, complexity, and costs between different between each of them?  In this session, we will explore multiple approaches and analyze the benefits, pitfalls and performance characteristics of each.

Bring your own backup vendor!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We are proposing a backup service with RESTful interface to discover instances, create guest quiesced, CG snapshots of Openstack instances that can be read out for backup, archiving, DR. The APIs would allow any backup vendor to read vdisk snapshots, block map, changed blocks (since previous backup) from outside of Openstack over HTTP(S) by a backup vendor or from within a service running in Openstack (for existing backup drivers). The proposed backup service would internally communicate with nova for discovery and taking instance level (image) snapshots. The service would mount cinder snapshots as block devices over different protocols, e.g. Iscsi, SAN, librados etc. to local system as it does today and would expose them over RESTful APIs. Eg. A snapshot read interface would look like : “https://<IP>:<PORT>/backup/v1/read/<vdisk snap id>” along with POST data containing a list of offset,length pairs for vdisk blocks to be read.

Building a Highly Available OpenStack Storage Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data availability is just as important as data reliability.. if you cant get to it then you might as well not have it!  Deploying a storage solution for Cinder, Swift, Manila and even just standard user data with Openstack has to include a level of availability both from a single site perspective as well as a multi-site perspectives.  This session dives into options available for storage in from the block side with scale up options in single and multi-site solutions, scale out options for object storage as well as the backend storage needed for services like Manila.  The types of storage today will be detailed and where each type fits will be shown.

Building a solid storage foundation for traditional and new workloads in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today, it feels like the the IT world is going through changes faster than ever: the emergence of Third Platform, DevOps as a new way of working, or for example containers as a new way of running and deploying applications. However, at the same time, traditional workloads continue to exist and still need to be operated. This poses a challenge for IT departments, since they now have to manage new, as well as existing workloads. Short-term, it may be feasible to operate different platforms for each of these workloads, but mid-term, a consolidated platform based on OpenStack is obviously desired. In this session we will discuss how you can design a solid storage foundation for your OpenStack cloud, while not only accommodating traditional business applications, but also new workloads on the same platform. We will discuss the different types of data in cloud environments and provide recommendations for how to deploy and manage storage in a modern hybrid cloud datacenter.

Building reliable Ceph clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceph is the most popular Software-Defined-Storage technology used with OpenStack. It enables a multitude of block, object, and file storage use cases, and its flexibility allows it to be configured as required for many different scenarios. The hardware environment can be similarly tailored. This is a sizable decision matrix, but leads to an environment optimally tuned for the required balance between performance, functionality, and cost. Dependability aspects - availability and reliability in particular - are often overlooked. Based on twenty years of development and hands-on experience with designing dependable distributed systems and supporting them in production, the goal of this presentation is to make you confident in your choice of Ceph for your use case, and to build an architecture you can trust. Beginning with choosing the appropriate access method for your workload, we then continue to introduce the algorithms and technologies in Ceph as they relate to resilience and High-Availability. We will discuss the considerations involved in optimizing a distributed storage system for reliability, availability, and durability of data and fault tolerance. We will look at the performance of Ceph in degraded and recovery scenarios, and how to reduce exposure. This affects the choice of hardware, the approach to feature selection, and system architecture. We will also talk about operational procedures to reduce unplanned downtime, speed-up recovery, and improve supportability.

Ceph Storage in PayPal Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation with focus on how Ceph is used to provide a low cost block storage alternative in PayPal Cloud. Existing block storage in PayPal Cloud was expensive and not applicable for several use cases. Hence, we decided to onboard Ceph block storage and integrate it with the existing OpenStack deployment in PayPal. Ceph block storage is integrated with cinder as a separate backend so that users/customers could continue to use block storage but have Ceph as an option in addition to the existing backend. This presentation will focus on the challenges encountered to enable Ceph in PayPal Cloud and the solutions adopted to overcome them. We will cover the following topics: 1) Ceph Deployment and Configuration 2) Ceph RBD and OpenStack Integration 3) Enabling Ceph as Cinder backend 4) Ceph Performance Evaluation 5) Monitoring Ceph Cluster

Ceph, containers and performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containers and the world of microservices have been getting a lot of traction recently as companies are investing in containerizing their applications. Storage is an integral part of the solution and forms a key component of the architecture, as the entire platform must be deployed, managed and orchestrated in containers. The Ceph cluster will be entirely containerized, all daemons will live inside Docker containers. After explaining why we are doing this, we will go through several use cases for containerizing Ceph and orchestrating it with Kubernetes. We will start from the deployment phase, and continue on to upgrades and the entire management life cycle of the solution. We will characterize the storage performance of applications running in containers that are using the Ceph kernel block driver (krbd) to provide persistent storage. We will close with a reference architecture of how to optimize krbd for the lowest latency, catering to RDBMS hosting environments.

Ceph, now and later: our plan for open unified cloud storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceph is a highly scalable open source distributed storage system that provides object, block, and file interfaces on a single platform.  Although Ceph RBD block storage has dominated OpenStack deployments for several years, maturing object (S3, Swift, and librados) interfaces and stable CephFS (file) interfaces now make Ceph the only fully open source unified storage platform. This talk will cover Ceph's architectural vision and project mission and how our approach differs from alternative approaches to storage in the OpenStack ecosystem.  In particular, we will look at how our open development model dovetails well with OpenStack, how major contributors are advancing Ceph capabilities and performance at a rapid pace to adapt to new hardware types and deployment models, and what major features we are priotizing for the next few years to meet the needs of expanding cloud workloads.

Cinder Next : Towards "Truly Software Defined Storage” Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cinder has come a long way and it now supports many storage systems, making it truly a vendor-independent storage controller. In other words no vendor lock-in. However, there is more work to be done for it to qualify as a “truly software defined storage controller”. In this talk, we will give insight into what things the Cinder project community should consider for the upcoming road map so that it can distinguish itself as the best SDS solution available. We will offer a candidate list of new features and capabilities such as storage discovery, performance based port selection, storage migration hardware support, etc. For each feature, we will delve on how they can be implemented, and why they are the features to be considered for Cinder roadmap.

Converge and Conquer: OpenStack Converged Compute with Ceph SDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deployment factors of orchestrated converged compute with Ceph block storage explored in this talk. The hyper-convergence server is a software-centric architecture that tightly integrates compute, storage, and networking on commodity hardware. Many compute servers in the in data centers have internal storage disks, but block storage is provided by dedicated SANs.  As a result, much of the local storage on compute nodes remains un- or underutilized. Ceph stores data on distributed commodity servers and provides interfaces for object and block storage. While Ceph is often run on dedicated servers, it can make more sense to converge OpenStack compute and Ceph on the same nodes and employ the unused local hard disks as drives for Ceph OSDs. Converged Ceph can significantly reduce storage costs in comparison to proprietary iSCSI arrays.  It allows for a scalable storage infrastructure that grows as compute capacity increases, and eliminates the need for dedicated Block storage system.

Crystal: Open and Extensible Software-Defined Storage for OpenStack Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Crystal is the first open and extensible Software-Defined Storage architecture for OpenStack Swift. Crystal provides simplified policy-based storage management to system administrators in a "If-This-Then-That" (IFTTT). These policies can change the behavior of  the system by transparently intercepting object requests with storage transformations or filters ("That"). The enforcement of filters may be static or dynamic based on monitoring metrics ("This"). Crystal's dashboard extends Horizon for enabling administrators to write policies and monitor the system. Crystal integrates several storage filters and monitoring metrics that demonstrate its feasibility. For instance, Crystal handles policies that enforce data compression or caching on object requests based on a container's activity, or it can enforce multi-tenant bandwidth differentiation. Moreover, both storage filters and inspection metrics can be plugged-in at runtime to extend the system's capabilities in a transparent manner.

Doppelgänger - Towards Disaster Recovery Support in Ceph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceph is a highly scalable distributed storage system and the heart of SUSE's software defined storage solution. Ceph clusters are usually deployed in single site. Although a multi-site configuration is also possible, it may hurt the overall performance due to the conjunction of strong consistency and high-latency channels. Disaster recovery (DR) is an imperative feature for maintaining critical data safe. In the newest version of Ceph (codename Jewel), a solution for disaster recovery support was designed and implemented for the block device interface, and named as RBD Mirroring. The approach to support DR is based on the asynchronous propagation of block device operations to a remote (geo-distant) site. By being asynchronous, the operation mirroring does not interfere with the critical path of the primary site functioning, and thus the performance penalty becomes negligible.


* **Ricardo Dias** *(Ricardo Dias is currently a senior software engineer at SUSE Enterprise Storage Team working in the development of Ceph a distributed storage solution. Previously, he was a researcher in the areas of concurrent programming and distributed systems, published several scientific papers, and received a doctoral degree from NOVA University of Lisbon.)*

Eliminating bottlenecks by rethinking storage design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The traditional design of Distributed FS binds storage control nodes and storage media within a storage server, and connects storage servers by Ethernet networking. All of major DFS such as Ceph, HDFS and Gluster FS use the same design. Nowadays, this old design already constitutes the bottleneck of storage system. It is the time to rethink this old design, and make a change. SurFS introduces a new architecture. It separates storage control nodes from storage media but rather converges storage control nodes and compute nodes resulting in extremely short I/O path. SurFS also leverages SAS-3 networking which has very large bandwidth (up to 96Gb) and very low latency (a few microseconds) to constitute an ultra-fast storage system at low cost. Furthermore, this new architecture has a unique feature of globally shared storage pool. This feature enables RAID for DFS (instead of RAIN) to reduce 50%+ disks at same data durability, which is ideal for HA and enabling re-balancing in seconds.

Enabling a Policy-Driven, Self-Service storage provisioning control plane for a Service Provider 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Storage self-service is one of the important tenets of modernizing IT. Storage provisioning typically takes days to weeks time due to the complex approval processes and application requirements getting translated into storage capabilities. Service providers aim to achieve agility, operational efficiency and improved service levels by allowing application and server teams to provision their own storage, on-demand. It allows the storage team to free up critical resources and improves operational efficiency, while maintaining IT control via policies to avoid any erroneous self-service errors.In this talk we present how we have used Openstack successfully to enable self servicing and API based automated storage provisioning for one of the largest service provider (IBM Global Technology Services). We will share the lessons learnt from the perspective of IT service provider and many customers across the globe on what has worked well vs what did not work as expected.

Forget everything you knew about Swift Rings - here's everything you need to know about Swift Rings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Swift is designed to make the most durable and available object storage system possible from your commodity hardware. From a few terabytes to dozens of petabytes and beyond Swift uses a consistent hashing ring to ensure data storage locations are dispersed to ensure failure-resistant operations of your clusters running at scale. Swift operators are ring masters. They interact with them constantly to maintain order in their clusters, adding new capacity to power their growing cloud, removing or replacing old and busted disks and nodes, or creating new powerful differentiated storage offerings based on their clusters unique characteristics, geography or features. In this talk we want to give you a deep dive into the rings: low level details how initial placement and rebalance works, best practices when designing cluster topology and ring management, and what you need to know about recent and upcoming changes like overloading, increasing partition power and composite rings.

Geographically resilient Object Storage with Ceph Radosgw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Radosgw (RGW from here on) is Ceph's Object Storage frontend providing an Openstack Swift and Amazon S3 like api.It also integrates with Openstack Keystone for identity management, making it a good candidate for object storage in Openstack deployments. DR strategies are essential in ensuring that critical data is never lost. With the latest version of Ceph (Jewel) active-active multisite RGW has been implemented, allowing writes to any of the remote clusters, allowing for data and metadata to be recovered in case of a datacenter loss. Data writes are async, allowing for this to happen without taking a major performance hit.In hopes of clearly representing the place of RGW in Ceph & Openstack ecosystem, we'll look into the current status of  Multisite in Ceph and look into the internals and architecture of RGW, how objects are stored internally, synce'd across a  remote cluster and the various caveats and troubleshooting tips based on our work with RGW.

Give me Cinder volume for containerized apps on top of baremetal node!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Storage is an essential part of any computing systems. In OpenStack, Cinder provides persistent storage, but currently, Ironic only supports integrated storage and is not available Cinder volume as an external storage. By utilizing external storage at Ironic, user can run enterprise workloads on bare metal servers to ensure stable and predictable performance, and better data consistency etc. Also this can be applied to containerized apps on top of baremetal node. Enterprise workloads such as Database, fail over with state-full application on container need persistent and stable storage. There are two ongoing effort and one lacking feature to enable volume support for containerized apps on baremetal. - [Ironic] Cinder volume support- [Magnum] Ironic support- [Magnum] Volume support on baremetal node(not started) In this session, we explain recent updates of Ironic and Cinder integration effort and then discuss Ironic support for Magnum and volume support for container.

Go - Why and what of Swift is moving to Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Swift is large-scale storage, and it has been successfully deployed in thousands of places all over the world. We're constantly looking for ways to improve performance and efficiency in the system. At its most basic level, Swift brokers network requests and disk access. Since networks and hard drives work very differently, managing each of these so they are both used efficiently is a difficult technical problem. This talk will cover the various strategies the Swift community has used over the years to provide better performance for end users. We'll examine each in detail, including their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we'll conclude with a discussion on the current work that's being done to reimplement some parts of Swift in the Go programming language.

How do I move my elephants? Uncovering the mystery of Cinder and Manila Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cinder and Manila have proven to be effective providers of Block and File storage in OpenStack. Both projects have come a long way in providing a self service abstraction to a wide variety of storage systems and technologies that may exist in your data centers. Through the Newton release, there has been a great deal of focus in solving other important use cases such as high availability, data protection and disaster recovery which are critical in production environments. Through this session we will help you compare and navigate through the design and internals of the solutions that are available today. We will demonstrate how you can leverage the host level disaster recovery in cinder and tenant driven data replication in manila. We’ll discuss standard configuration best practices to benefit the use case/s you are trying to solve. We’ll take a sneak-peek at what’s in the works for the evolution of these features in the Ocata release and beyond.

How to migrate a large Swift cluster to Erasure Coding?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Erasure Coding (EC) is full of promise. Do you want know how you could convert your clusters to EC without wasting months to download/upload your petabytes? Come to see how we did it. We will first quickly explain what is EC and how it works in Swift. We will then spend more time describing the migration process we designed, our choices about the method and how we made it scale to PB of data and billions of objects. We will also talk about the traps we fell into. This talk will also be the occasion to give a feedback on EC at scale, what you should and should not do when deploying EC in your clusters. Finally, we will see that with few improvements, this method can be reused for other needs.

Increasing Cloud's storage capacity to meet the dynamic growth demands of your tenants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The unceasing addition of new tenants and their growth's demands for storage requires frequent capacity expansion activities on the Cloud's storage infrastructure.  Meticulous efforts by a savvy staff with the precise expansion strategies are keys to successful deliveries of new storage in production environments.  My intention is to disseminate the practical experiences that were acquired through the deployments of new storage to production environments.  Adding storage capacity to the production sites without the tenants experiencing the service interruptions ensures a healthy tenant base.    A CEPH storage cluster is designed with the ability to increase the storage capacity dynamically.  CEPH gives us the ability to dynamically add the needed storage to an existing storage cluster to serve the new demands.

Intelligent Archival Systems for Cognitive and Analytics Workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session discusses how the Ennovar Lab at Wichita State and IBM are combining emerging technology based on metadata search with OpenStack Swift object storage to create a next generation, cognitive and analytics enabled Intelligent Archival System.  The intelligent archival system integrates with custom metadata tag and search technology and Swift High Latency Media (SwiftHLM) middleware. It allows users to tag objects with application specific custom metadata and enables content aware migration of the objects to and from low cost storage pools such as tape or SMR drives based on the custom metadata. By placing the custom metadata on flash / SSD and making it readily accessible via REST API, cognitive applications as well as emerging analytics frameworks such as Spark can efficiently gain insight from the metadata while still achieving low cost due to the use of higher latency storage such as tape. A live demo of this capability will be included.

Keep your Data Lake Healthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A growing and aging data lake might fast become a polluted dump, plug up your pipes or might even overflow if not maintained. There is a growing demand for further object store management functions to keep the lake clean and healthy. For example to automatically compress and expire object data, as well as place data using an optimal storage tier, to allow access from file interface (SwiftOnfile), or save private data in an encrypted format. The session begins with a short overview of the swift storage policy mechanism and how it can be used to separate the object data stored in the underlying storage system. Further we will explain how combining the features of storage back ends with swift storage policies creates new functionality for your object store. This presentation includes examples and demonstrations. Keep your data lake clean and healthy. Add important data management functions to your object store, by (easily) attaching the needed storage policy and storage back end to it!

Living on the Edge: Scalable Edge Caching and Disaster Recovery with OpenStack Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As industry shifts towards building their own private and public storage clouds, OpenStack Swift has become an invaluable storage platform with numerous tools in the toolbox.  Once objects are distributed across multiple geographies though, the toolbox becomes lighter and lighter.  Currently OpenStack Swift assumes a mostly homogenous set of data centers over which to distribute data, which does not take into account that not every data center is created equally.  We are building an object storage solution, which builds upon unmodified OpenStack Swift, that supports on-disk caching of objects at edge data centers while always being stored at an organizations primary data centers that contain the DR, backup and archive facilities.  In our solution, applications can continue to failover and failback between data centers in the case of a disaster, but are no longer required to store a piece of the object store at every site.

Manila share data does not simply move and protect itself, oh wait, it does!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Typical datacenters comprise of products from multiple storage vendors, and usually no two products behave the same. Thus, operators often rely on complex scripts and tools to move data, provide high availability and protect it from disasters. As a multi-storage abstraction, OpenStack Manila is invested in addressing such requirements through a consistent API to avoid vendor lock-in. We have made tremendous progress with features such as Migration and Replication, and a new service that can handle data plane operations and assist in moving data between shared file systems. We enhanced the design of storage availability zones as failure domains and allowed for them to be consistent with Nova and Neutron availability zones. We will discuss use cases and demonstrate the use of these features while indicating best practices and troubleshooting tips that might come in handy when using both these features in your data center. We’ll also discuss the roadmap for these features.

Openstack swift object storage simulator for scale test using Containers/VMs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Swift has ability to scale to a huge object store but to test this with large no of physical nodes can leads to a higher cost constraints. In order to overcome the dependency on the physical nodes and HDD to configure Swift we deployed Swift proxy and object nodes on VMs/containers running on any hypervisor/docker-host. Thus we can have a large number of proxy and object nodes having required no. of virtual disk drives (by adding external storage from any storage array to the hypervisor/host ) to meet a scale of required object storage. We will cover the following:• How to deploy and configure proxy and object node as a VM/container• How to clone that VM to create required number of proxy and object nodes.• How many proxy and object nodes on a single baremetal hardware can be deployed and cost savings• Automation to deploy swift services on cloned VMs – Deploy hundreds of swift nodes within minutes• Test results and comparisons with physical nodes.

OpenStack Swift: Say hello to object storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Swift object storage is designed to scale on commodity or enterprise hardware. Swift enables data to be stored efficiently and cheaply. Accessing the stored data has become a major problem as everyone wants the data to be highly available across platforms and from their devices. Swift answers this need consistently and safely with Representational State Transfer (ReST) APIs.In this session, we’ll show that Swift is a long-term storage system with scalability, redundancy, and permanence. We’ll demonstrate how it stores data in an object form and how object replications work. We’ll also discuss Swift object versioning, which allows object/data archival. Its storage policies enable different storage implementations, like selecting different physical servers or disk as needed. In this presentation, you’ll see object versioning, access control, and storage policies in action.

OpenStack’s Storage Performance:  Can you handle the truth?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Choosing the right storage for OpenStack is not a simple task.  Deciding what storage to use is a big problem in and of itself, but understanding how that storage performs, what its operational complexity really is, and what real workloads actually look like running on it are questions that anyone running OpenStack in production is faced with.

Protecting File Shares in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data protection is a vital requirement for any enterprise. No one likes to be caught off guard when the power goes out or the storage array goes off-line. Hence, choosing the right backup solution is critical in today's make-or-break economy. This is why Manila's storage backend replication capabilities are of critical importance! Not only do they allow OpenStack clouds to offer Shared File System based replication, but also enable users to achieve fail-over and fail-back. However, there are other potential solutions. We will discuss additional ways to achieve data protection for shared file systems, and explain how they work. We will demonstrate these alternatives, and try to fit them into use-cases that they are most suitable for:  Manila with a 3rd party backend driver Manila with Smaug and storage strategies Manila with Smaug and Swift Manila with Smaug, Swift, and Neutron (protecting both share data and share network) Freezer: The OpenStack Back-up as a Service Platform

Realizing the dream:  Openstack + Ceph for low-latency block storage workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceph continues to be the leading block-storage-of-choice for Openstack VM deployments. Latency-sensitive workloads such as databases remain an emerging Ceph use case - latency guarantee typically a challenge in shared VM storage environments as compute/networked-storage resources cease to scale as VM density increases. With growing flash footprint on clients, flash-based read/write caching has the potential to improve storage latency by reducing IO path dependency on network/cluster. We'll introduce an ordered, crash-consistent read/write-back cache native to the Ceph block layer. Blocks will be cached on client-side SSD/NVMe/3DXPoint/NVRAM device. A shared cache mode will be supported which is an ideal fit for VM master image cache. A big feature-up from current object-based, DRAM-based cacher - flash increases cache size on packed hypervisor and improves cache warmup on restart. We'll delve into the high-level design and demonstrate performance gains with this new Ceph-RBD cache.

Second-level recovery of volume in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

     The topic involves the field of data protection in OpenStack. In order to meet the needs of recovery to the closest point after the disaster, we introduce the continuous data protection (CDP) technology in OpenStack. CDP is a technology which can continuously capture and save the changes of data to another independent location. Theoretically, it can recover to any specified point in the past. We apply the technology in OpenStack to provide second-level recovery of the disk in the virtual machine based on KVM. When a fault occurs, the disk can be recovered to the nearest time or any second.      In addition to describing the technology of second-level recovery of volume in OpenStack, this topic will provide a demo, demonstrating how to use and manage it.

The Efficient Object Store:  Large Scale Geo-Distributed Erasure Coding Swift Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deployments of large-scale geo-distributed Swift using local and distributed erasure coding compared in this talk. Common swift data replication is 3x, assuring that each copy is on a different drive and a different storage node.  However, 3x replication, result in low hardware utilization comparing to RAID solutions.  Erasure coding has been recently become available in Swift, making data replication a more efficient 1.5x in a single location.   Greater data durability can be achieved by replicating the objects across multiple data centers.  With replication across data centers, resiliency can increase from 3x9’s in a single data center to 8x9’s with two data centers and 12x9’s with three data centers.  More recent developments allow for geo-distributed erasure coding which drive higher hardware utilization across data centers.  Instead of keeping full local replication, data can be distributed across 3 or more locations while maintaining a low 2x replication across all sites.

The Open Hardware Alternative: Geo-Distributed Swift Deployments at Scale with OpenPOWER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deployment factors of geo-distributed Swift using OpenPOWER CPU and hardware covered in this talk. As an alternative to Intel x86 CPUs, the POWER8 is a 4GHz, 12 core processor with 8 hardware threads per core for a total of 96 threads of parallel execution. It uses 96 MB of eDRAM L3 cache on chip and 128 MB off-chip L4 cache. POWER CPU hardware is as traditional server as well as OCP form factor. Building on the open edict of OpenStack, the POWER CPU is open source and governed by the OpenPOWER foundation. With certain applications, it has been shown to be a very power-efficient CPU. A stable OpenStack component such as Swift makes it a logical candidate for running on a large scale. Swift has now been ported and is available to run on POWER8-based hardware.

Towards Zero ETL: Unifying data management across PaaS,CaaS and IaaS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Recent trends in application deployment point to hybrid deployment models cutting across PaaS, CaaS and IaaS runtimes.  A single deployment model cannot cater to all application types. Often enterprises need to deal with a mix of easily decomposable applications (12 factor micro services) and monolithic legacy applications. Common amongst them is need for data sharing and persistence. In this talk we will highlight the challenges in managing and enabling shared data access from across different runtimes such as Cloudfoundry, Docker and Openstack to common shared data.  We will share our experiences building data centric storage services for seamless data sharing using storage plugins for Docker, Cloudfoundry and Nova and highlight performance, resiliency and security implications of each of the alternatives and conclude with a common set of best practices.

Unleashing the power of Oracle Database with shared filesystems and OpenStack.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Oracle Database can give superior performance when used with ZFS storage Appliance over dNFS. ZFS Storage appliance(ZFSSA) has hooks to listen to cues from the database over dNFS. This reduces the tuning effort required when provisioning shares from Manila when integrating with a database. The compression ratios are also improved drastically when integrating Oracle database with Manila on ZFSSA. dNFS enables fibre-channel like performance but with reduced operational and capital cost of file based storage. With DTrace based analytics in the ZFSSA, it is easy to identify individual database's performance which can help with storage optimization and identification of performance issues. There will be a demo in which the database will be hosted on a VM on Nova and the shares on ZFSSA will be provisioned by Manila.

Delivering Composable NFV Services for Business, Residential, and Mobile Edge with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Service edge routers, also known as provider edge (PE) routers, deliver business, residential, and mobile subscriber services with functions that include broadband network gateway (BNG), BGP/MPLS VPNs, and evolved packet cores. With the advent of NFV, many of these services can be disaggregated and provided through modular virtual network functions with service function chaining which offers far greater flexibility to compose, deploy, and automate services rapidly on x86 based servers. Service providers are exploring methods to bridge the service edge and cloud paradigms together to achieve the best of both worlds. In this session, the speakers will provide some background on service edge routing and discuss architectures that could help service providers with options in evolving the service edge routing architecture to achieve the agility of cloud and service richness of edge routers.

Gluon - Accelerating Development of New Networking Services for OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T has recently been driving the vendor community to come up with an NFV-ready networking architecture for OpenStack.  Working with OPNFV they identified a set of networking use-cases use-cases that are not cleanly addressed with Neutron. Gluon is our initial attempt at creating a model-driven approach to implement these use cases.  We started by creating a new set of APIs specificially for L3 VPNs.  At OPNFV in Berlin we demonstrated interoperability between four vendors' SDN controllers within a single Openstack cloud.  Our framework allows us to create new network models rapidly, switch new models in and out without impact, and for those models to serve multiple controllers and clouds within a telco network. In this panel we will discuss use cases needed by the operator; the networking services needed for these use cases; how the vendor community is participating in this engagement; and how we want to work with OpenStack to implement these services.

Lessons learned from the field: Tips and tricks for NFV in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Telecommunications companies around the world have typically used physical hardware to accommodate traditional call flows in the wireless world. With the introduction of OpenStack and network functions virtualization (NFV) into the telecommunications enterprise, there are endless possibilities for consolidation of hardware, reduction of overhead, automation of deployment, and other desirable goals in the age of cloud computing. In this session we will present some of these possibilities, along with challenges and lessons learned as we look to design future solutions. Discussion topics include: -Is OpenStack ready for carrier grade networks? (uptime, call reliability, 911 applications, etc.) -Call flows and the difficulties that they present -Why packet size and IPv6 are important and challenging -The challenges in orchestration and automation that exist in the telco enterprise -Environment testing and validation with Rally and Tempest -NFV application onboarding difficulties

NTT West - Beyond Neutron, taking control of a physical multi-vendor network with OpenDaylight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron provides a rich set of functionality to deliver fully featured networking services between OpenStack tenants. However the roles and responsibilities of Neutron end here, to deliver broader networking capabilities and take programmatic control of the underlying network an SDN controller is of value. OpenDaylight is a popular SDN controller, it provides multiple southbound APIs and a model driven abstraction layer allowing systematic programmability of multi-vendor devices. Current efforts to integrate OpenDaylight into an OpenStack environment have focused on simply delivering the same functionality as Neutron. In this presentation we will demonstrate how OpenDaylight can be used to configure underlay network elements such as a firewall and expose this ability as a service for OpenStack tenants to take advantage of, essentially allowing physical FWaaS.

Open Source Networking: From Telco to Enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Open Source and Standards are inspiring and enabling new technological breakthroughs, with groups like OpenDaylight, OPNFV, ONF, ETSI and others pioneering the way forward. Carriers and enterprises are increasingly asking vendors to deliver solutions based on open source with varying results. NFV for example has become one of OpenStack’s fastest-growing use cases. The industry is going through a major transition, with critical questions having been answered (e.g.,the need for multiple protocols) but new ones being raised (e.g., the role policy and intent, how to scale out centralized control, evolving role of OpenFlow). OpenDaylight Executive Director Neela Jacques will give an overview of the state of open source networking, the role of OpenDaylight as the de facto standard for SDN and NFV, how it’s evolved from roots in the telecom space (and why carriers are early adopters of large-scale deployments), emerging use cases, case studies and end user adoption trends and predictions.

Service Flows for Containerized VNF Distributed across clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The VNF in telecom or other industry are interested in capabilities like service chain so they can dynamically stich services together as needed. The requirement is being able to both define service chain and also manage the data flows to those chains based on dynamic configurations like user profiles. A service chain defined in Networking-SFC is applied to port pairs and will act on all the traffic following those ports. A combination of NSH headers and ODL based policy enforcements are possible but they require the service aware VNFs be deployed for the flows to work. In order for VNFs be deployed as is and have the data flows redefined to suit the data path requirement is the focus of our technologies that are based on OVS / OVN and/or Neutron. This presentation will offer a few options and also demonstrate one of our implementations. Our current implementation is for containerized VNF, though will work seamlessly for VM based VNF or a combination of both as well as multi-cloud.

Telco grade OpenStack deployment using containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many of today’s Operators have successfully rolled out virtualized OpenStack to build their private clouds.  This approach offers a standard way to deploy and manage OpenStack to support different size of clouds and workloads. The next logical step forward is to use container technology to achieve additional optimization in footprint, availability and operations while deploying OpenStack for large private clouds. More specifically, the use of Kubernetes for a container framework to deploy OpenStack is of interest to many Operators and vendors alike. This presentation will focus on the challenges as well as the lessons learned from an effort to stand up OpenStack in Kubernetes based container framework with additional features such as policy, security, networking etc. We will also share our vision and requirements for building an OpenStack cloud that can scale from two bare metal hosts on up, using container orchestration principles to more effectively manage large and diverse clouds.

"REST API driven Compute Node configuration for enabling EPA based placement of VNFs by MANO"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

VNFD templates allow for specifying requirements for VNF workloads that leverage features of a compute node such as NUMA topology, SR-IOV, PCI-Passthrough, Huge pages and CPU pinning. This allows for Enhanced Platform Awareness(EPA) driven placement of VNF workloads to achieve better performance. However the cloud administrator is required to pre-configure computes to enable for EPA usage. The manual steps involved here are not scalable considering size of typical Telco clouds and can be error prone.  This talk introduces a REST-API driven ability to configure/modify compute nodes to enable for EPA usage. OpenStack Tacker (or other ETSI MANO clients) will be able to query which compute nodes are configured for EPA usage and the respective resource allocations. In addition this talk will highlight the need for enhancing/extending OpenStack (e.g. Nova) APIs for retreiving detailed EPA relavant resource usage information from compute nodes.

A  generalization of the OpenStack networking model for L2 VPN MEF compliant SD-VPN service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A strong analogy between the network models of Neutron and SD-VPN is presented. Using this analogy, a MEF compliant SD-VPN service was implemented while leveraging the generic network virtualization infrastructure of NetVirt in ODL. The resulting VPN service offers L2 and L3 connectivity between geographically remote locations each based on a local OpenFlow switch. A mapping service is used in order to allow information exchange between these locations for the purpose of MAC address, IP address and route distribution. The sites are interconnected by an overlay network carried on top of an arbitrary IP network. The presented solution allows for a MEF compliant SD-VPN service without dependency on technologies such as MPLS, strongly simplifying this process.

A Tour of the Open Source NFV Eco-System: Create, Integrate, Deploy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are a lot of open-source projects which deliver components of the NFV eco-system. The puzzle has many pieces like fd.io, IOvisor, OpenO, OSM, OpenDaylight, CNCF, CNI, Cloudfoundry, etc. – though they all center around OpenStack and OPNFV. This session is putting the different open source projects in perspective and shows how they all organize into a "big picture" – with a special spotlights on OpenStack as the cornerstone project as well as OPNFV as the system-level integration project which equally drives NFV-focused feature evolution and continuous system level composition and testing.

Accelerating Enterprise Cloud Adoption with Murano: AT&T Telco Use Cases and Lessons Learned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T is one of the world's largest-scale users of OpenStack, and an aggressive proponent of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) on the OpenStack platform. As they've explored the performance-critical NFV use case and confronted the challenges of building out a viable, 'carrier-scale' business around these technologies AT&T has had to discover new ways of enabling and automating operations for speed and repeatability. One of AT&T's key tools is Murano — which offers a framework for packaging components, apps, and complex stacks, along with configuration details, providing these in an informative catalog for rapid selection, dialog-driven configuration, and automated deployment at scale. It's an example of an advanced tool that serves AT&T's need to describe and package complexity, and to distribute components, apps, VNFs and stacks across organizational boundaries while also simplifying Ops procedures — maintaining control, accelerating ops and working efficiently at telco scales.

However, automating provisioning tasks across multiple, and possibly even heterogeneous, sites is proving to be quite challenging. For this reason, numerous use cases and requirements have been created around the matters. This presentation will show how to use the OpenStack Tricircle project to automate the network provisioning across multiple sites, as a precursor to very fast VNF networking via FD.io's VPP (Vector Packet Processing) project.

I designed the first Linux and open source-based NAS appliance in 1997 at NetAttach, which was acquired by VA Linux Systems. I also developed the industry's first unified block/file stack back in 2003. I'm  a developer in OPNFV, FD.io, OCI, and in varios IoT communities.  I do also run an open source non-profit, Yunify, that is focused on creating software to help spark the NFV ecosystem. With the standards community deciding on OpenStack as the Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) of choice, I am also very interested in building out the necessary infrastructure components to make this more optimal. This requires me to be fairly impartial as I look at all the various efforts, which might help bootstrap that ecosystem.  As the PTL for ONOSFW, I lead and develop a lightweight framework to instrument the NFVI (NFV Infrastructure). Currently, the first release of ONOSFW can be found in the Brahmaputra release of OPNFV and is still building out the network framework. The next release will add a unified Intent interface to the NFVI Networking.  Lastly, I am also one of only a few developers working in the area of NVMoE. NVMe (Non Volatile Memory express) is a storage protocol that was designed to remove the CPU as the storage bottleneck. However, due to the architectural constraints of PCIe, the only way to share NVMe storage, in a disaggregated fashion, places the bottleneck back in the CPU used to share access to the protocol. NVMoE places this technology onto an Ethernet fabric and allows the client to talk the NVMe protocol over Ethernet, in a fashion that eliminates the CPU bottleneck. I currently work on kernel, FTL, flash, drivers, and management software to help support this important ecosystem building block. )*

AIOrchestra. NFV VIM through TOSCA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AIOrchestra is an engine to process TOSCA DSL to real deployment process. AIOrchestra allows DevOps/Developers to write TOSCA templates to describe how they want to see their apps in clouds and the way how it would get into cloud. AIOrchestra is aimed to be more than just yet another orchestration solution on over-polluted market. This framework designed to be a ground for more complex solutions. So, why AIOrchestra and NFV mentioned in the same context? NFV in the nutshell is just a cloud infrastructure and software, so why do we treat it as totally different beast? Because NFV was a huge new open initiative and it allows to reconsider the way we use clouds and its networking operations on the regular bases. From its initial design AIOrchestra allows developers to build their platforms for further app delivery by using TOSCA and AIOrchestra engine capabilities, in this case NFV VIMs.

Asking the right questions for Storage in NFV deployments, so that you can forget about it !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Architects designing NFV deployments are currently focusing most of their time on providing solid network, compute and automation layers. This is due to the fact, that solving especially network on scale is a challenging task. Nevertheless, most Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) require persistent storage to provide their services.

Automated Cloud Infrastructure Deployment for Telco
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Telco operators have a special set of requirements when it comes to cloud environments. A single cloud must support different functional use-cases (hosting, service function chaining) applications requiring different performance requirements fully integrated and automated end-to-end lifecycle management In this session we will talk about how Deutsche Telekom achieved that goals by creating an OpenStack environment, which is distributed across multiple DCs in several regions. The network foundation for the overlay network and the service function chaining as well as the interconnection between the different DCs is provided by the OpenContrail SDN solution. Canonicals MaaS and Juju provide the lifecycle management, including the fully automated deployment of OpenStack, OpenContrail and Ceph elements into a highly complex and secured network setup. Telco requirements, current status, time used, lessons learned and solution gaps will be explained. Join the presentation and you will know.

Automating the VNF on-boarding process using OPNFV Functest and OpenStack Heat templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The NFV story is built around virtualizing network functions. To achieve inter-operability, VNF setup and fulfillment must be based on a common information model, which today is specified by ETSI. For acceptance by CSPs, the VNF should be validated using a universally accepted testing method.  This presentation and demo will define an end-to-end VNF validation process,  from VNF descriptor definition to testing the VNF, using the OPNFV Parser and Functest projects with an on-boarding wizard tool built on standards. The web-based wizard guides the user in defining the VNF Description details and to define the VNF setup metadata in an implementation agnostic, ETSI standards based format (ETSI NFV Yang format). The wizard then converts this format into the implementation format consumed by the VIM layer. In this case format is converted to OpenStack Heat Orchestration templates using the Parser project in OPNFV. We will also talk about ongoing work for conversion to TOSCA NFV profile.

Automation Testing: Leveraging the right open framework for VNF Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Yardstick is an open-source tool to verify compliance of the VNF environment. The use cases are taken into consideration from ETSI GS NFV 001 which suites the need for the highly complex environments. The use cases is considered in Yardstick in form of test cases. Yardstick needs access to the Openstack to create and ssh to VMs, connection to external network of the environment. The project's scope is to develop a test framework, test cases. The VNF Workload Characterisation Framework supports the automated testing of VNF platform configurations and the capture of associated data in an OpenStack Cloud Environment. The framework provides orchestration of the full test lifecycle including deployment of the VNF, starting/stopping packet generation, collection of test data, creation experiment metadata and termination of the test case

Benchmarking hardware accelerated OVS with VSPERF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network Functions Virtualization involves using cloud management technology like OpenStack and deploying the network functions on COTS servers (scaling out) to achieve high aggregate throughput. For NFV deployments to work properly, it is very important to ensure that the virtual switching function in the NFVi does not become a data bottleneck, starving VNF applications.  To address this problem, an emerging trend has been to accelerate the virtual switching function in hardware.   For this reason,  precisely understanding the performance characteristics of the virtual switching function, with comparison to accelerated and non-accelerated implementations, is critical.  In addition, the testing of the virtual switching function must be done under conditions that closely approximate the real-world traffic load on the target VNF applications.  This is often difficult with existing test methodologies, but can be improved as we will discuss in this presentation.

Can we use OPNFV Doctor framework in OpenStack?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In telecom operation, fault management is essential to achieve high service availability. This is typically realized by a monitoring system which is specific to hardware and application as they are tightly coupled before introduction of NFV. To realize the same network service availability in NFV, we have to make sure to have the same level of monitoring functionality in a cloud type platform. The OPNFV Doctor project focuses on this requirement and has proposed missing features to the OpenStack community. We present our implementation of a fault management framework for NFV realized by different OpenStack services and comprising various exemplary use cases of compute/network/storage resource faults. This talk also provides insights on how to adopt this framework to various types of deployment models and operational policies utilizing Congress and Vitrage. The results of multiple PoCs will be shared to show the performance of this framework in particular w.r.t immediate notification.

Create VNFs on the fly - VNF Components in Tacker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Tacker is OpenStack based generic NFV Orchestrator and VNF Manager that instantiates and manages Virtual Network Functions(VNF). Virtualisation Deployment Unit(VDU) is the granular part of VNF which hosts the network functionality in the nova instance.  Currently, Tacker requires glance images or image location which has preinstalled network function like firewall etc., One of key requirements of operators is to have loose coupling software component and the underlying image.  As per ETSI MANO standard, VNF Component(VNFC) is the object which creates network function in the underlying nova instance. In this talk, we are going to walk through the following points. How Tacker adopts VNFC to instantiate the network function in VDUs. Onboarding of VNF Descriptor which embeds VNFC and deployment of VNFs. Various drivers in Tacker which supports communication with VDUs and how to introduce a new VNFC driver.

Data Intensive Virtual Network Functions on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The successful adoption of NFV depends on the ability of cloud infrastructure to deliver sufficient performance compared to today's proprietary network appliances. Generic hardware isn't equipped, nor configured, to handle this kind of load, and as a result, can't run with the necessary performance large carriers & Telcos require. To achieve such performance, you need advanced processor & networking technologies embedded in silicon and in PCIe devices, but even so, you need to ensure your VNFs are ultimately able to leverage these capabilities. In this talk, we'll show how NFV throughput performance varies depending on proper VNF workload placement configuration, by declaring what the VNF requires from the hardware (SR-IOV, DPDK, etc) and ensuring proper matching & configuration with the OpenStack NFVI. We'll also see how Enhanced Platform Awareness & smart orchestration are enablers for such extreme performance.

Data Performance testing on NFV clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Normally vlan traffic is generated from a traffic generator to the VNF under test and looped back to the traffic generator to measure the throughput and latency of the VNF on N/S and E/W topologies. However, there are much more metrics like the VNF boot time, VNF processing performance and  vSwitch processing performance with variable CPU/Mem/Other resource allocations and bandwidth allocations, that can be done across multiple different topologies for both vlan and vxlan with different acceleration techniques like DPDK, SRIOV and PCIPT used in the VNF.In our presentation we cover the following,-Different L2/L3 topologies for both vlan and vxlan, with and without DVR-vlan/vxlan Traffic generation tool used-Comparing data performance results across different acceleration techniques to identify performance bottlenecks-Brief demo showcasing variable VNF/Vswitch resources allocations and its impact on data performance

Deploying network latency sensitive workload for NFV in Helion Operating System (HOS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Virtual bridges are used in OpenStack to offer flexibility to create segmented tenant networks for East-West and North-South traffic. Use of bridges limits the network throughput generated by Virtual Machines, and hence not suitable for NFV workloads. An alternative approach to ensure network throughput for such latency sensitive workloads is to use PCI-SRIOV and PCI techniques.  In this presentation, we will talk about: our experience of enabling PCI on Intel and Mellanox network controllers. how in HPE, we have managed to automate and simplify the deployment of PCI devices to work with OpenStack how easy it is made for a cloud provider to stand-up a cloud supporting deployment of network latency sensitive tenant workloads using PCI-PT and SRIOV techniques. The session will end with a demo of how a tenant VM with PCI-SRIOV/PT would communicate to other normal VMs on the virtual bridge, thus retaining the East-West and North-South traffic untouched, but with greater throughput.

Domino: Distributed Template-based Orchestration Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Template based orchestration is used by multiple OpenStack projects including Heat, Tacker, & Senlin. Model based network programming and configuration are also heavily adopted by SDN controllers (e.g., ODL, ONOS). To be able to consume orchestration services in another domain, specific drivers need to be written with explicit knowledge about the north bound API as well as the template formats and domain specific features.  OPNFV project Domino is responsible for creating, translating, and distributing orchestration templates for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) from a common network service descriptor. It is a critical indirection layer to solve the pain points of automatic capability and policy discovery as well as VNF placement. Our talk will cover the use cases and architectural design of Domino. We will also provide a demo to show Domino in action with distributed OpenStack sites running different orchestration engines such as Heat and Tacker.

Driving NFV High-throughput performance using user space fast data processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Clouds are gearing towards the next generation NFV application which demands high data-rate performace from the cloud. On the otherhand opensource technologies like VPP (Vector Packet Processing) are rapidly growing to cater high performing network application needs. VPP natively runs as a Linux user-space process and creates a vector of packet indices and processes them using a directed graph of nodes resulting in a high performance. If a controller supports OpenStack Neutron (as OpenDaylight does), this provides a easy mechanism for VPP to integrate with Openstack. In this session, join Velmurugan Kumar and Vinay Rao to get an overview on how technologies like VPP can help to deliver high performance resilient networks for Enterprise and Service provider applications. Also the session will go over some scale and performance tools/measurements that can be used to measure the Openstack cloud performance.

Dynamic Network Fabric for NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV deployments are moving away from POCs in labs to building a multi-site, NFV-compliant OpenStack solution. Many NFV use cases, such as vCPE, vBRAS and vBNG, all require dynamic scaling, agile resource balancing, and geo redundancy across multiple PoPs (Point of Presence).  We argue that the current OpenStack does not handle network dynamics well because the lack of network-aware resource allocation. In this talk, we present an OpenStack enhanced dynamic network fabric that offers high availability, manageability, and performance required for carrier-grade. To react to network dynamics, e.g., traffic spike, or resource failure, we provide underlay network aware PoP level rerouting. Within the PoP, we find the best resource reallocation via bandwidth-guaranteed VM placement. In addition, we use SLA verification to check if the reactions satisfy the SLAs. Our framework can free function-developers from attending to carrier class requirements.

End to End Architecture Design for NFV workloads: from Hardware up to the Cloud layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Communication Technology industry with the help of Telco Application Vendor and IT industry are guiding a transformation phase that will move network functions from disperse, dedicated silos to a shared common infrastructure. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) workloads running of a cloud platform, with respect to IT applications, should rely on an End to End Carrier Grade (CG) architecture meeting at least "five nines" high availability standards and guaranteeing very intensive performance KPIs. This session will guide the attendees on the key requirements and design principles of a CG platform starting from the physical layer, moving to the virtualization layer and concluding with the Cloud platform. For each of these architectural layers, key aspects of compute, network and storage domains will be discussed. After watching this session, you should be able to understand the key principles to take care in the design of a CG infrastructure suitable to host NFV workloads.

Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA): boosting dataplane performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is all about deterministic, maximal network packet processing performance. The Openstack community has implemented various technologies towards this goal, but those need carefully configured and combined to be effective. This talk will show how to configure Openstack to provide this performance for NFV workloads using Enhance Platform Aware (EPA) features already available, such as CPU pinning, Huge Pages, PCI pass-through and Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), showing best practices applied in Telefonica NFV Reference Lab with Red Hat OpenStack Platform. NFV workloads require to assign dataplane interfaces to guests in order to maximize Virtual Network Function (VNF) performance. This is usually accomplished by allowing the VNF to rely on DPDK technologies, alone or in conjunction with the pass-through of physical and virtual functions (the latter commonly denominated SR-IOV) from the host to the VNF guests.

Heterogeneous Cloud MANO deployment experiences and levaraging enterprise IT for NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We will present a PoC model for implementing a MANO deployment service offering distributed across an OpenStack Cloud,  a public cloud and an OpenShift (Kubernetes/Docker).  The service consists of multiple CloudRouter VNFs providing routing and VPN functionality across multiple clouds with the service terminating at a Container-based IMS.     The Open Source ManageIQ CMP, provides top-level orchestration including configuration of individual components through Ansible / Ansible Tower integration.  Tacker provides VNFM functionality within OpenStack while ManageIQ provides VNFM functionality in the public cloud.   TOSCA is used for service description. While OpenStack and NFV are at the heart of the POC,  we will show that a more practical way to accelerate the creation of an open source MANO is to start with a CMP product that already has most of the attributes for managing cloud-native applications and is already proven, by being widely deployed.

How to Lower TCO for Network Modernization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the Key Challenges of Service Providers (SP) is Total Cost of Ownership for a new tech site/lab. Especially for PoC/Staging Labs where SP tests & integrates new products/solutions before buying/rolling out in production, they are costly (building, maintaining and operating) and they are mostly under utilized across the calendar year. In order to address temporary site/lab needs via Global Cloud SP offer amazingly low cost compute, storage solutions and they provide secure private channels for Operating, Administrating and Mainatining (OAM) of it. In this presentation we will show how easily be Openstack IaaS to be deployed over AWS and also real time show of cost of resources over AWS Billing System. This approach can be used as reference and improved for low funded Tier3s for network modernization and allows VNF vendors to offer true "pay as much as you use" model by using AWS statistics and Analytics Tools.

How to make OpenStack relevant for Mobile Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has been the choice of virtualized infrastructure for hosting Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). Networking abstractions supported in OpenStack Neutron (i.e., port, sub-net, net) and services such as Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS), Firewall as a Service (FWaaS), etc. cover a broad range of enterprise use cases. Yet, these services and networking abstractions also fall short of addressing the needs of next generation mobile network architectures particularly in the context of providing different mobile network stacks and verticals to different tenants. Our talk will cover some of the 5G use cases such as connectionless services, edge cloud, context aware networking and provide a discussion around new networking abstractions such as programmable buffers, mobility management as a service, and measurement as a service.

Infrastructure and service modeling strategies to deploy NFV in production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This panel brings together operators, tool and platform vendors, and telecom system integrators to discuss the challenges of obtaining meaningful and actionable insights when designing and deploying modern carrier-grade services in real world scenarios.  NFV and OpenStack provides vendors and network operators with transformational capabilities for service innovation and architectural flexibility. However, this flexibility introduces significant complexity in VNF service modeling, performance testing, verification and ongoing maintenance. The panel will explore how network operators can successfully manage OpenStack-based NFVI and VNF selection and onboarding. Including how automation frameworks together with comprehensive and integrated verification procedures are being used to accelerate service delivery, verify interoperability, performance, reliability and security.

Meeting SLA: NFV Notification and Remediation using Tacker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The advent of NFV has changed the way TELCOs are beginning to deploy network functions. NFV has brought benefits in terms of deployment agility and cost reduction while also introducing virtualization layers that add complexity and operational challenges. One of the critical requirement for TELCO to maintain SLA is that identifying the abnormal situations of running VNFs and address them to bring it to normal operational state,  automatically or manually. This requires monitoring, async event notifications, remediation such as scaling which has been addressed collectively by OpenStack services tacker, ceilometer, heat, etc. In this session, we will discuss in detail about these features and how OSS can use them automatically to handle the abnormal situations.

Migration from "Carrier-Grade" to "Service Provider Cloud"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For many years, the Telcos adopted the term “Carrier Grade” for a system, hardware or software component that is extremely reliable, well tested and proven. Carrier grade systems are tested and engineered to meet or exceed "five nines" high availability standards.  However, in today’s exploding volume of bandwidth demands, networks have become increasingly complex and need to efficiently and reliably handle diverse traffic types and patterns requiring different types of resources for Compute (CPU and Memory), Storage and Network (I/O). Today, Service Providers need to deliver service with high Reliability, Availability, Manageability, Performance and Security (RAMPS) across the entire end-to-end ‘Service Provider Cloud’ system, with the objective of minimizing the business impact of of service outages in order to meet their Service Level Agreement (SLA). This talk is about why Telcos need “Service Provider Cloud ” solutions rather than just “Carrier Grade”

Network traffic telemetry with OVS DPDK in Monasca
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Handling the ever increasing network traffic requires NFV to design and build networks that have scalability, flexibility and elasticity to it. One of the widely used tool for this purpose is the Data Path Development Kit (DPDK) libraries. Heavy traffic seeds the need to perform efficient network analytics over DPDK which involves monitoring network metrics such as Tx/Rx throughputs. Currently in Monasca, when ports are DPDK enabled, the libvirt plugin does not store and query metrics measurement/stats for the ports and hence is unable to collect the network metrics.We address this problem by collecting the metric for DPDK port using ovs plugin integration with the monasca-agent. Ovs plugin fetches the port stats from ovsdb using ovs-vsctl commands and store the queried metrics in a cache and from there we calculate the rate for the tx/rx packets for the dpdk enabled ports.

Neutron software-defined interconnects with WAN BGP VPNs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The networking-bgpvpn Neutron project allows to create connectivity between Openstack VMs and BGP/MPLS VPNs. These VPNs are a cornerstone of operators' backbones and interconnect datacenters, businesses or NFV POPs. Interconnecting them on-demand with Openstack is a critical piece of the NFV and hybrid cloud puzzles. This needs to be done in a controller-agnostic fashion to let automation and orchestration code be free of ties to a specific solution.

NFV Considerations for OpenStack on VMware Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Large set of Telco companies use VMware for running their enterprise workloads today. The next big movement is on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) which would help them to reduce capEx, OpEx and improve agility. The demands of NFV is significantly different from traditional enterprise workloads especially when it comes to reliability and performance. Even though virtualization helps in high degree of automation and resource utilization, NFV still needs to be dependent on physical hardware (passthrough, physical switch configuration etc.) to meet the SLA. OpenStack is being considered as one of the main components in NFV layout primarily for standardized APIs and ability to work with wider ecosystem. This talk will cover details on how OpenStack on VMware provides a path towards addressing carrier grade requirements by better capacity planning, guaranteed resource allocation, improved performance with SR-IOV/direct passthrough, and configurable latency sensitivity options.

NFV Multi-VIM Management and Orchestration (MANO) with a VMware/OpenStack Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Telcos have been waiting for the world of open & interoperable collaborative software to replace existing & costly proprietary black-box hardware.  The promise of NFV on OpenStack makes all this possible, however many existing network functions have been written to run on existing VMware environments, & achieving the true benefit of multi-VIM NFV interoperability & portability has been a challenge.   Many of these organizations are looking to leverage existing investments & reliability of VMware architecture, coupled with the new open & futureproof world of OpenStack-based infrastructure. To enable the seamless portability between existing architecture to cloud environments, multi-cloud orchestration is key.  This live deme will show how to compose services on top of hybrid cloud environments, transition legacy apps & VNFs between VMware & OpenStack, with some components running on VMware and others on OpenStack, all through a single pane of glass, to leverage the best of both worlds.

NFV Orchestration with OpenStack - An Open Source MANO Perspective on Status and Extensions Needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV Orchestration with OpenStack - An Open Source MANO Perspective on Status and Extensions Needed. This talk will focus on NFV Orchestration challenges and the impacts on OpenStack from the perspective of the telecommunication service providers through the lens of the Open Source MANO community.  A number of scenarios will be described to clarify the types of deployments that telecoms service providers are looking to leverage OpenStack for. Open Source MANO is an ETSI-hosted project to develop an Open Source NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) software stack aligned with ETSI NFV. It will be reviewed to provide some context on the architectural choices that are being made at this layer of the stack which impact the Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) requirements. A review of some of the things that are considered to be working well and the areas that need immediate development.

NFV Service Assurance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the overwhelming adoption of Openstack, tools such as Ceilometer can be leveraged to build a service assurance platform that performs autonomous event correlation from different network sources. Ceilometer, along with other open source monitoring tools, can provide an NFV Service Assurance Platform. This platform receives data from tools such as nagios for hardware, sflow for network information, ceilometer for VM and VNF's performance & fault through VNFManager/Orchestrator and  many more.  Service assurance in NFV can truly help to extend services such as self-optimization and self-healing within networks where Correlation engines correlate collected data and perform root-cause analysis, service impact analysis and inter-op with policy management and VNFs. Assurance helps user to predict any stoppage in service and perform the corrective action. The actions may include evacuation, live migration, scale out/in based on the policy defined by the network service.

NFV use case. Software-defined vRouter with AIOrchestra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AIOrchestra is an engine to process TOSCA DSL to real deployment process. By use of modern python 3.5 technologies like coroutines with async/await syntax AIOrchestra allows DevOps/Developers to write TOSCA templates to describe how they want to see their apps in clouds and the way how it would get into cloud. AIOrchestra is aimed to be more than just yet another orchestration solution on over-polluted market. This framework designed to be a base ground for more complex solutions.   In NFV, the most widely spread use case is - virtual router. So, it does really matter how you get router into OpenStack, would it be Neutron plugin or would it be a NFV on top of OpenStack. The most flexible way to get vRouter into OpenStack is to use TOSCA as modelling language and AIOrchestra as tool to convert TOSCA into executable graph.

NFVO / Enterprise CMP convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV has embraced OpenStack as the preferred platform for NFV Infrastructure.  ETSI and other organizations have proposed models for the management layer above the NFVI/VIM while ignoring a lot of the early work done for Cloud Computing in the Enterprise.   We propose that the ETSI MANO functionality above VIM layer closely resembles current Cloud Management Platforms (CMPs) developed for the enterprise.  While Cloud Computing is new, enterprise CMPs have a had a head start on developing frameworks for managing cloud infrastructures.  Enterprise CMPs have already addressed many of the issues related to managing complex applications such as inventory, chargeback, and monitoring.  While the usual justification for embarking on a new development effort for NFV is that NFV has much greater performance requirements for the infrastructure, we propose that adapting current, mature enterprise CMPs to address NFV management requirements is a much faster approach than starting from scratch.

On the Journey to Cloud Native VNFs on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Explore a platform that can bring VNF development closer to becoming fully cloud native.   Network functions have advanced significantly from their original dedicated hardware. Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides the underpinnings of much of the recent work around Network Function Virtualization. While there are containerized VNFs, running in a container does not necessarily mean it is cloud native. In general, VNFs are not cloud native yet.   In the Use Case section, several questions will be considered to determine whether your service may or may not be cloud native. While some VNFs have challenging requirements and are difficult, the majority can be made cloud native.   We will review what it means to be cloud native and explore a platform that can help bring VNF development closer to being truly cloud native on an OpenStack cloud.

OpenStack Adoption in Telcos for NFV: drivers and blocking factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We’ve been hearing a lot about the use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for delivering virtual network functions in a cloud. In this area, OpenStack has quickly gained a lot of attention from Telco Providers and Application Vendors. The evolution of OpenStack itself is strongly influenced by NFV requirements and use cases, and this is proven by the great amount of Blueprints and initiatives which are NFV-related (e.g. OpNFV). This nevertheless, the adoption of OpenStack in production is quite low, and most Telcos are still in evaluation mode, performing PoCs in their test labs. This session will present to attendees drivers and blocking factors for OpenStack adoption in the Telcos: why is OpenStack so appealing with respect to other platforms? What are the requirements that are driving its development and evolution? What are the blocking factors that are slowing down its adoption in production environments? And what are the community and vendors doing to address them?

OpenStack and the Orchestration Options for Telecom / NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many open source orchestrator projects which are attempting to accelerate SDN/NFV deployment in operator networks, Open Source MANO is targeting how to deploy NFV based on the ETSI MANO specification; OpenStack Tacker starts from a VNF manager and is evolving from there with the help of other projects; Open-O (Orchestrator) explores areas beyond the MANO specification by including SDN orchestrator, legacy networks, and OSS; ManageIQ and others could evolve from cloud/IT managers into an NFV orchestrator; and at the same time, AT&T published the ECOMP whitepaper which augments the ETSI MANO story with policy, closed loop control, VNF onboarding, SDN configuration. This panel will address how we plan to harmonize multiple orchestrator projects to better align on modular code within each project. There are many common new modules like Parser, VNF onboarding, EPA, Generic VNF managers, event streaming, which could benefit from the cooperation among multiple open source projects.

OpenStack controlled IoT  Gateway to manage a Smart Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Interaction between proprietary Internet of Things Devices along with their data management and security presents a lot of complexity presently. UC Berkeley’s Swarm Lab have come out with a secure, open, distributed data logs called the Global Data Plane, with a communication platform to solve this problem. In this talk we show IoT platform framework or a Universal Software Plane for Smart Homes. Our IoT Gateway platform is based on GDP, which we have containerized and use OpenStack based Flotilla’s framework on the cloud side to establish a dynamic vpn tunnel from the openstack gateway to the Swarm Box and deploy containerized apps on it remotely using a single pane network function portal based on Horizon & Murano. The apps deployed on the swarm box would be having the capability to read/write logs either on the openstack based cloud or on the local distributed data store along with big-data kind of closed loop analytics, making the swarm box a personal cloud for Smart Homes.

Operations Dashboard: Looking past the Horizon at Telco Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Large telcos like AT&T have begun to realize that a hybrid “shared nothing” architecture for a cloud is the only true way to provide the level of reliability and resiliency we need. Doing this , however, adds challenges around how to provide a single pane of glass view for your entire cloud platform without bogging it down and expending limited datacenter resources. Beyond Horizon, operators at telco scale also have a need to use and view intelligent logging/monitoring/alerting solutions that look beyond OpenStack. Big data provides intelligent frameworks for logging/monitoring/alerting and opportunities to leverage this data to improve the reliability and resiliency of our cloud platform. We will go into some strategies that we think would benefit other operators in their environments.

OPNFV SFC with OpenStack and OpenDaylight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data centers today are becoming more and more complicated to manage. Adding new services and changing the related networking usually requires involving system and networking admins and can take weeks to complete. Software Defined Networking (SDN) promises to improve this situation, and Service Function Chaining (SFC) will make it even easier. We will show how integrating OpenDaylight (ODL) SFC with OpenStack and a VNF Manager, all in an OPNFV deployed environment, can greatly increase the manageability of data center networks. We will show how the VNF Manager creates Service Function VNF VMs on-demand, based on the needs of different Service Chaining configurations. Once multiple service chains have been created with their respective VNFs, we will show end-to-end traffic through the different service chains, and show how the tenant traffic behavior transparently changes depending on the service chain being used. Demos will be Vagrant-based VMs, enabling participants to dig in at home.

Optimizing, Configuring and Deploying NFV VNF's on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A deep technical discussion on how to best leverage Nova scheduler to configure and deploy applications for NFV.  Virtual Network Functions (VNF’s) typically have critical performance targets and need to predictability get the performance they expect every time they are launched.  The scheduler is a complex beast and knowing how to best leverage its wonderful capabilities to maximize performance will be demonstrated.  We will compare performance with and without leveraging the scheduler parameters that are available and highlight the delta. Providing predictable access to resources for VNFs is a critical part of a successful NFV deployment and we will show you how to accomplish this important goal.

Orchestrating VNF Forwarding Graphs and SFC using OpenDayLight, Neutron and Tacker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Successful deployments of complex Network Services needs dynamic control of traffic flows through VNFs.Even when using SDN, adding new services and changing the related networking in the underlying networks can still be a challenge. Service Function Chaining (SFC) addresses these complexities, making even the most complex scenarios quite simple. SFC implemented in an SDN Controller, like OpenDaylight (ODL), must interact with additional components to automate the entire Service Chaining scenario. A VNF Manager, like Tacker, is necessary to manage the life cycle of VNFs.  Multiple layers need to work in cohesion to make this a reality. This ability to support dynamic VNF Forwarding Graphs using Service Function Chaining differentiates various NFV Orchestration stacks out there in the market. In this talk, you will hear how three opensource projects - Tacker, Neutron and OpenDayLight SDN Controller - coming together to achieve this holy grail of the NFV promise.

osm.etsi.org identified gaps in OpenStack for high performance network applications.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Open Source Mano identified gaps and proposed solution from osm.etsi.org high perf networking use cases Use case is  virtual routers (vPE)  which interconnect from different regions, must reach the bandwidth of the physical lines (over 40 Gbps with small frame sizes), and be capable of managing directly ethernet framing, so that subinterfaces can be dynamically created and destroyed by the VNF based on in-band signaling. We achieved the goal with a combination of pci-passthrough and DPDK applications to achieve a scenario where 3 vPE could be automatically configured thanks to modeling and reach 99% usage of the 10G lines. We will deep dive into that issue and how we overcome them and directions we experiment. The examples being part of http://osm.etsi.org Release 0  can be reproduced.It is a call to the OpenStack community for providing the best solution for solving this use case.

Out of the Box Resiliency for Network Function Virtualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many virtual network functions available today are software representations of hardware and can consume large quantities of dedicated resources, which often sit idle, to meet capacity requirements. By developing a framework that shifts the burden of providing resiliency away from the NFV vendor towards the operator, we believe many of the obstacles impeding the ability to create cloud solutions which meet capacity needs and optimize resources can be removed. AT&T has devised a framework for NFV that provides resiliency features as services that can be leveraged by the NFV vendors. This allows vendors to focus on function versus cloud resiliency and helps eliminate legacy dependencies from the NFV as resiliency breakpoints. Another aim is to help encourage vendor participation by facilitating resiliency that can be customized to an operator’s specification. Vendors can then avoid having to create vendor specific resiliency implementations for each target operator.

Overview of AT&T’s Cloud Workloads: Before, and After OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Have you ever wondered about the different types of cloud workloads, and service integration use-cases a typical large operator manages on daily basis? Join us for this session as we walk through a diverse set of workloads, application and service delivery patterns that are powered by our OpenStack cloud platform. Running all your workloads on a common unifying platform is a great vision to pursue. However, in a complex multi-vendor multi-solution landscape that a large operator deals with regularly, the key to executing this vision becomes technology integration. We'll cover: The process to deploy new services going from 2-3 weeks of time line, down to minutes with the help of cloud platform and other tools. For a telco provider, a legacy way of launching a new service would have involved commandeering multiple disjoint technology blocks with significant lead time. Whereas now, with the help of Gluon, Yardstick and OPNFV platform this becomes simple, predictable agile process.

Place your VNFs smartly with a smart network monitoring tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Orange is using Openstack in several contexts, from public cloud with Cloudwatt to private cloud distributed all around the world for NFV use cases. Thanks to those experiences, devops teams at Orange agree that better tools to troubleshoot networking are needed. From one deployment to another, we may not use the same SDN controller hence operation team can't rely on dedicated SDN analysers tools. With the emergence of container based VNF, having a unified tool that NFV operations teams can use in mixed environments to monitor, troubleshoot NFV deployments makes a lot of sense. For those purposes, a tool such as Skydive providing live network metrics looks appropriated. This could be helpful to orchestrator tools or even used by the Openstack scheduler to smartly run network constrained applications in geo distributed cloud environments. This kind of feature will soon be needed since ETSI NFV will allow VNF to specify network constraints on virtual links between VNF components.

Problem prediction/detection assisted by AI running on Distributed Analytics & Monitoring framework.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Robustness against unexpected problems such as silent failures caused by software bugs and failures of server components is important for operators of telecom and cloud services. Fast detection of problems, and predicting them is crucial for us to avoid serious situations. We propose Distributed Analytics & Monitoring (DAM) framework to achieve real-time failure management in OpenStack. For fast detection, DAM deploys an analytics/monitoring agent into each compute node, and each agent can collect statistics from the local environment and analyze them very rapidly. A typical application of DAM for prediction is running AI to learn huge statistics locally, so that we recognize problems 30 minutes in advance of actual failure with 94% precision. Optionally, an orchestrator reacts to invoke auto-healing. DAM greatly helps improve the scalability and real-timeness of cloud and NFV infrastructure. DAM also helps us detect micro-bursts of demand, fast change of configuration, etc.

Real-Time KVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting near real-time performance for VNF applications requires designing the application with timing requirements in mind and profiling its performance under realistic conditions. OpenStack has developed many functionalities that helps in this, such as CPU and PCI topology awareness and pinning the virtual machines to dedicated cores. The host networking stack, in turn, has been optimized with features, such as accelerated virtual switches and DPDK. One crucial piece of the NFV infrastructure that deserves attention is the performance of the hypervisor layer itself. In the case of the open source, standard kvm hypervisor, the OPNFV project kvm4nfv has been optimizing its latencies to meet carrier-grade requirements. This presentation gives an update of the kvm4nfv project and its recent achievements.

Resource Assurance for NFV Workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Availability and Performance are key attributes for NFV workloads. On the other end of the spectrum, service rollbacks are becoming increasingly expensive to address and an impediment to NFV adoption. Resource assurance for network services would ensure that no service deployment would fail due to resource requirements. It would also ensure that network services continue to provide the expected quality of service since their resource requirements would always be met.

Root Cause Analysis for NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Fault Management is a critical component of the NFV effort. OpenStack Vitrage, with its RCA  support, brings OpenStack one step closer to giving NFV the tools it needs to become a reality. Fault management in NFV is complex. Problems at physical layers impact the virtual layers, resulting in service disruptions. Due to the high performance required in Telecom systems, fast fault analysis and response is critical in this domain.  NFV Services are comprised of virtual resources that may be distributed across separate (OpenStack) clusters, so failures in one cluster can impact performance in the other. Tracking this impact chain across layers in a production-grade system is challenging. In this talk we present how Vitrage uses its latest Heat data source to give insights into VNF-related faults, and how Vitrage provides a clear and holistic view of the system, from physical infrastructure to the VNF, which can then be used to drive application management policy.

Scaling OpenStack to support large scale Compute – 500 Computes and beyond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has known scalability limitations and scaling beyond 100-200 compute nodes per single OpenStack instance (Region) is a challenge. Scaling out to support 500 + nodes in a single datacenter is possible by deploying multiple OpenStack instances in that location but that adds extra overhead, cost and management complexity for tenants.   In this case study, we will share our performance and scale test results, fine tuning that ‘worked’ versus ‘did not work’ to support the scale and the architecture changes made to OpenStack deployment to support 500+ compute nodes per OpenStack region.   We have addressed bottlenecks in the messaging bus, Nova scheduler, and other key components, with a combination of: Control plane flexibility (moving services to different hosts) Configuration changes particularly with RabbitMQ and Nova Tuning the use of Ceilometer

Service Assurance, a challenge for Network Functions Virtualization(NFV) -- What can OpenStack do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Service Assurance and FCAPS are funtions of Telco operational support systems(OSS). Monotoring fault/performance and autoprovisioning are extremely important for Operationalizing the Network services. While Virtualization and Cloudification of the Network Services is the obvious path forward for Telecommunications, it has presented with the new challenges in handling the Service Assurance aspect. What can OpenStack do? 1. Is Telmetry ready for the task? 2. Is OpenStack keeping up with the ETSI MANO requirements with respect to Service Assurance? 3. How are the various modeling specifications and tools helping with closed loop Service Assurance?  As the Telco Solution Architects at Red Hat working with a major Telecom Operator, we will talk about our first hand experience with the challenges and present some potential solutions.

SFQM & Doctor: Keeping my (telco) cloud afloat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Additional statistics facilitate more resilient and performant telco/NFV clouds. It is vital to monitor systems for malfunctions that could lead to users' application service disruption and promptly react to these fault events to facilitate improving overall system performance. By providing OpenStack with system statistics from collectd, more data is available, which can be used for monitoring, performance analysis, fault detection, etc. using OPNFV Doctor-prescribed enhancements to OpenStack, action can then be taken to negate the effects of any faults in the deployment. Gaps have been identified and work to improve OpenStack to enable a more fault tolerant cloud environment is well underway. A key part of this work includes expanding the amount of data available about the system (e.g. DPDK and Open vSwitch statistics) and improving alarming functionality in OpenStack Aodh. This presentation is a follow-up of the last OpenStack summit in Austin.

Solving Distributed NFV Puzzle with OpenStack and SDN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many NFV use cases call for deployment of service elements at the provider network edge.  5G nodes, PGW, CPE, caches, all need to be placed near the end user to ensure efficient and cost-effective performance of the corresponding services.  With NFV, elements previously implemented as proprietary hardware appliances, can be virtualized, deployed on COTS servers and centrally managed.  In this presentation we'd like to share an approach to deploying distributed OpenStack-based NFV in a carrier network with an ultra-light edge composed of optimized Nova Compute Nodes and a centralized control plane placed in a provider DC with integrated SDN solution.  We'll discuss different deployment options, their advantages and disadvantages as well as present the learnings derived from a PoC deployment with a demo of the resulting solution.  In addition to addressing architectural challenges inherent to the distributed deployment model, we'll explore performance and distance related implications.

STEER: An Implementation of Service Function Chains using Network Service Header (NSH) Encapsulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Modern networks due to the explosion of connected devices obligates the need to support different levels of quality of experience whether it is for web browsing, online games, messaging etc. This level of experience is expected to be provisioned by the way the traffic is steered across the network by a set of network service functions (SFs) called service function chains (SFCs). The SFs need not reside on the direct data path and can reside on the cloud or data centers. In this talk and demo, we introduce a simplified solution for Dynamic SFC orchestration (STEER) which implements Network Service Header (NSH) encapsulation inside OpenStack as per IETF recommendation. The solution consists of a control plane (SFC Controller) with REST based APIs to configure the data plane (Traffic Classifier, Service Function Forwarder and Service Function Proxy). The STEER APIs makes SFC implementation and prototyping simple and fast. The solution supports both NSH-Aware and NSH-Un-aware SFs.

Streamlining VNF Management: Requirements for a Generic VNFM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  The NFV promise is a “standard” and “commoditized” VNF deployment environment phasing out proprietary hardware network appliances, which are configured and managed by vendor-specific EMSs. Management of the virtual infrastructure is being simplified by VIMs, i.e. OpenStack, but as vendors virtualize their VNFs and make them cloud ready, existing EMSs are augmented to provide the VNFM function.  While this coupling might allow vendors to utilize their knowledge of the application to enhance the VNFM capability it also continues the outdated practice of application-specific VNFMs. Generic VNFM would streamline the overall solution.   This talk presents work underway at Verizon to develop Generic VNFM requirements, which depend on the VIM capabilities, type and complexity of the VNFs, and a robust set of VNFDs. An analysis of the possible pros and cons of open source approach with projects such as Tacker, OpenBaton, Juju vs. vendor specific approaches, i.e. Nokia’s CBAM is also presented

Successful rapid NFVi deployment - take 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

During 2015 and 2016, many of the leading providers, such as Orange, AT&T or Telefonica have experienced some NFV lab trials, proof of concepts and some early NFV deployments. Based on these early deployments, NFV is perceived as a complex solution to be deployed with OpenStack. From 6WIND’s experiences, we have seen some lab trials which require many weeks before having an environment that is high performance ready. Most of the engineering efforts are spent in setting up the nodes because of the constraints related to the DPDK powering the NFVi virtual switching: setting up the proper DPDK PCI NICs, configuring the vswitch VLAN or VXLAN, trying to debug with tools like tcpdump, getting a SDN controller into the game, provisionning the security groups. Beyond 2016, getting rapidly a running NFVi will become critical for the maturity of deploying NFV. Fuel can be used to solve such rapid deployments of DPDK based NFVi.

SuperHEATed Orchestration: doing more with HEAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Use the powerful heat engine to do more than just application life cycle management. https://github.com/ckravi/super-heat Taking a real life production example of Telco NFV cloud delivering vCPE solution, we show that apart from  application lifecycle mangement and orchestration, there are other needs like  admission control, service class/SLA aware oversubscription, intelligent placement, VNF license management etc. Currently these aspects are built as management applications on top of heat.In this example we show how to create custom heat resources that can be used to efficiently solve business aspects of cloud application life cycle including priority based oversubscription, admission control, licensing etcEnabling this via the heat engine allows:- Uniform declarative business policies- Version controlled business policiesIn short, superHEATing for fun and profit.

The Implementation Synopsis of Gluon Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV brings new networking use cases in the L3 domain, for example, MPLS and L3VPN. Those new use cases need new networking APIs that are increasingly unlike Neutron, and need to be quickly developed and deployed in order to accelerate time-to-market and improve business agility. In addition, NFV requires the flexibility to use multiple networking back-ends in OpenStack, and to use multiple APIs and back-ends simultaneously. Gluon is a Model-Driven, Extensible Framework of NFV Networking Services that enable Telecom Service Providers to provide its customers with new NFV use cases on-demand. Gluon uses a model-driven approach to generate APIs from a YAML file which models the NFV Networking Service. Applications use those APIs to provide the new service. Thus, Gluon helps Telecom Service Providers accelerate the time-to-market and achieve business agility in NFV domain. This presentation gives an overview of the design and implementation of Gluon.

The Open Source Disruption in NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There is a massive shift in the NFV world to open source tooling and technologies, from companies like AT&T with their ECOMP project to other players such as OPNFV, ONOS, and OPEN-O, not to mention ETSI and MEF. However, this transformation, although positive for end users, means certain large corporations now have an inherent conflict of interest due to their business models being mostly driven by proprietary hardware. Some names include Cisco, Ericsson, Nokia, and Amdocs. In this talk, we will discuss the open source NFV vs. proprietary vendor struggle, where the NFV world is headed, and ways proprietary vendors can work to join the open source disruption without having a disastrous effect on their bottom lines.

The role of Neutron in OPNFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OPNFV is gaining more traction every day. Concepts are not always easy to understand, there are lots of new acronyms, moving pieces and questions still open regarding its relationship with OpenStack and specifically with Neutron. In this talk we are going to give answers to those doubts and questions. We will start with an introduction of OPNFV, what's its scope, what are the differences with OpenStack and what value it provides. Then we will move on describing the role of Neutron and associated projects in OPNFV, the most common use cases and configurations. We will illustrate how the OPNFV and the Neutron community interact: we will focus on some key feature (e.g. vlan-aware-vms) and explain how they built towards future capability that will be needed by OPNFV.  To conclude we will highlight current gaps in Neutron from the NFV point of view and we will share our thoughts about future work and directions.

TOSCA & Mistral: Orchestrating end-to-end Telco Grade NFV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Now you can orchestrate a full NFV service, with TOSCA templates & Mistral workflows on single/multiple geographies! There’s no doubt that workflows are a key ingredient for cloud automation, and automation is a key element in orchestration. However, when looking at an end-to-end, Telco grade, full NFV deployment over multiple distributed sites, orchestration starts becoming trickier. Using TOSCA as the main DSL for the Network Service Descriptor provides a hierarchical view of services, components and their relationships, which is decoupled from the underlying VIM/NFVI. When combining TOSCA interfaces and a mistral workflow, a full network service lifecycle can be achieved. The CloudBand Network Director, an NFV Orchestrater uses TOSCA based Network Service level description and modeling. In this session we will describe and demonstrate using TOSCA templates and a Mistral workflow engine to achieve Telco grade NFV orchestration with the CloudBand Network Director.

Virtual Network Functions (VNF) : From Machine to Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Open Source and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are forcing Telecommunication Companies to transform how they consume traditional network (and enterprise) functionality. For NFV, existing applications need to evolve in order to leverage the flexibility and elasticity of a distributed cloud platform like OpenStack. Virtual Network Function (VNF) vendors need to adapt their applications and make a “cloudification” process that will embrace OpenStack as the NFVi reference platform. One example of a “cloudification” transformation is Virtual Device Role Tagging. Traditionally, Network Functions (NFs) have ordered/named network interface card (NIC) devices in a consistent way based on either MAC addresses or PCI addresses. While the former still works,  it does not scale well in the cloud, and the latter is simply no longer possible. This talk will explain and demonstrate how to transform a traditional NF into a proper VNF using OpenStack specifications in terms of NIC ordering.

VITAL: A framework for Benchmarking and Characterization of Telco grade Virtual Network Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As we observe a proliferation of Virtual Network Function offerings from various vendors, benchmarking and performance characterization of these VNFs on an Openstack environment is of utmost importance. In our talk, we present a framework that has been designed and implemented at HPE, which uses a two pronged approach to the problem. In the first approach, we address the issue of determining an optimal output set achievable, for given a set of input virtualization knobs such as the sizing, VIF model, pinning etc.,. The output set is a list that can span across parameters such as throughput, latency, jitter or other VNF/solution specific attributes. The second approach of the framework is to start with a least-common-denominator input set of virtualization parameters and try to achieve an optimal output set by automatically varying the inputs. The framework also implements monitoring vital characteristics such as CPU/Memory/Disk/Network I/O and correlates this with the input sets.

VNF Service Modeling and Chaining on VMware Integrated OpenStack using TOSCA/YANG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the world of NFV, YANG is basically the data modeling language of choice for networking devices, where TOSCA has been selected by ETSI, MEF, Open-O, Open MANO, & many telecom carriers as the de facto modeling language for service orchestration. TOSCA, in the context of NFV, is a language that enables data modeling with a focus on topology and workflows, processes, and policies. Therefore, when you want to manage the full lifecycle of orchestration in an NFV use case, it is important for TOSCA and YANG to communicate seamlessly.  With the powerful integration of TOSCA & YANG it's possible to provision VIM resources, deploy software components & VNFs, wire them in and push configurations, & then chain them to other services. Here we will dive into the different service modeling options for virtual & physical network devices these days, how they communicate, and how to seamlessly deploy them on VMware and OpenStack using a TOSCA/YANG translator and open source MANO solutions

(e.g. Huge Pages, CPU pinning, NUMA Topology awareness, etc.). However, with limited performance vSwitch options, SR-IOV was used in many cases. So, the Telco VMs (VNFs) could have reached high packet processing performances / core, at the cost of hardware dependency and features flexibility and challenges to software control plane. Nowadays, Vector Packet Processing (VPP) technology, offers an interesting high performance I/O processing alternative for NFV. VPP also offers network features richness (yes, e.g. SFC with NSH is also included), flexibility, hardware independence and a 100% Open Source software vSwitch with open governance model, with an OpenStack,  OpenDayLight and containers integration in progress.

A Deep Dive into Customization in Horizon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Horizon is the official OpenStack dashboard providing access to your services via the Web UI. In recent releases, it has developed a robust plugin mechanism with customization at many levels. The goal of this release cycle was to make dashboard development as easy as possible - just one API call and a few lines of code away. Horizon now allows you to easily extend table columns, table actions, filter facets, workflows, detail views, cell templates, and much more!  We will explore all the recent enhancements to this architecture, demo how to make use of them in your dashboard, the best practices for your plugins going forward, and the roadmap for the future. This presentation is accompanied with a sample project for you to experiment with after the session.  Writing a new panel has never been this easy!

A generic network driver mechanism for Neutron -- One driver to bind them all
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron provides an extension mechanism by which network vendors can register their drivers to support the functionality of Switching, Routing and Security on their devices instead of on LB/OVS and Namespaces. Even though this works, a service provider or enterprise customer still has take care of installing the appropriate drivers and maintaining them across versions. In a mixed network vendor environment this problem gets more accentuated. The current proposal solves this issue by introducing a genric driver mechanism in the Neutron plugin flow  for L2, L3, FwaaS, LB and VPN services. This will result in day zero support of network vendor devices adhering to standards.

A look into the future: A consistent OpenStack GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack operators spoke – we listened. The lack of consistency throughout GUIs frustrates people. Alex and Rodrigo will discuss the research, collaboration, time, and effort needed to create a set of patterns that are easy to follow and easy to implement; showcasing the importance of GUI conventions to drive consistency. Join us and provide your insights, needs, suggestions, and concerns regarding this effort to improve the experience for both users and developers alike. Currently, OpenStack projects with a GUI lack consistent guidelines. This session hits on that pain point and provides the developers with the opportunity to be part of the conversation, to ask questions about the plan, and to get involved in the solution.

Adding dynamic configuration to Kolla Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Kolla and Kolla Kubernetes  are two primary projects that can be used to install OpenStack using containers and Kubernetes orchestration framework respectively.  While Kolla-Kubernetes is great, it does suffer from few drawbacks: Adding new service requires changes to the central kolla-kuberntes repository. Adding the service also means a way to create configuration ansible and password scripts in one location. There is no easy way to upgrade 'configuration' and services. This talk proposes changes to kolla-kubernetes architecture into a more service oriented architecture by introducing: a) A new service Kolla-Config that centralizes the configuration. b) Introducing 'Service-Manager' per component (glance, nova etc) that is responsible for generating and updating configuration. The result is a much more dynamic OpenStack installation and upgrade experience.

Agile Principles and OpenStack - Marriage Doomed to Fail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Agile Software Development has been the buzz on the market for quite a while. This talk will pick few of the most prominent principles from Agile Manifesto and use those to explain why agile methodologies are super unsuitable for OpenStack (or any similar large community opensource) development. Agile Principles are followed by multiple different implementations. This talk is not going to explain any of the implementations in depth nor it is going to list any pros or cons of the individual implementation. This talk is focusing purely to the issues that the principles of Agile Manifesto brings in at fundamental level. Obviously there is also things we can and should pick up from these Principles and lot to learn from the success of Agile Software Development, specially in the startup world. Perhaps the methologies would benefit most new projects that are just flowering within small groups.

Analyzing gate failures with subunit2sql, openstack-health and elastic-recheck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will cover how the OpenStack QA team uses subunit2sql to collect information about test results that have run in the gate and how to analyze and use data from gate with openstack-health and elastic-recheck. The resulting data empowers developers in the OpenStack community to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of their tests, identify and track test failures over time and subsequently prioritize which tests they need to prioritize improvements to.Common questions like the following and more will be covered: What is the OpenStack gate? What is subunit2sql? How is subunit2sql used with the gate to collect test results? What is openstack-health? How is data from gate handled with openstack-health? What is elastic-recheck? How is data identified and tracked in elastic-recheck?

Anatomy of an OpenStack distro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack development process rarely finishes when code is tagged for a release. Throughout the life cycle of a release, OpenStack distributions package, maintain, test, and turn OpenStack into a product that’s easy to consume by a large variety of users on their favorite operating system. In this presentation, you’ll get an inside look at the work that goes into shipping a stable OpenStack distribution on the same day as the upstream release. We will explain how the RDO community distribution continuously packages OpenStack from source, how we test it and how we ship it. We will share our experience, our challenges and how we overcome them in collaboration with the OpenStack community.

Behind the scenes of testing RDO, an open source community OpenStack distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack strives to provide APIs that abstract complex operations in order to mix and match different OpenStack projects, hardware, and network topologies. We verify that aspiration by testing an ever-growing matrix of possible combinations of installing and configuring OpenStack. This process is difficult and intensive. In this presentation, two engineers of the RDO community will share their experience testing trunk across these different installation scenarios. Join us to dive into the projects the RDO community uses to tackle this challenge, and learn how you can get involved.

Continuous Packaging, the next step after CI and before CD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We are used to the concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and how they’re applied to our daily work on OpenStack. However, we tend to miss the importance of packaging, even though a large amount of the current OpenStack deployments are done using packages rather than source. Enter the world of Continuous Packaging, where every commit to your OpenStack project gets automatically packaged and tested.This allows for early detection of new dependencies and issues and enables Continuous Delivery, the packaging way.

Debugging of OpenStack services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Murphy's law states: "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.". When it does, one should be able to deal with it. Complex systems like OpenStack with many moving parts inside tend to break often when deployed on a large enough scale. And when something breaks, it's crucial that a developer analyzing the failure knows where to start and has some sort of methodology to perform root cause analysis. Often people come unprepared and start trying things at random or stick to primitive debugging techniques (like inserting print statements in the code), which is at best time-consuming and inefficient and at worst does not allow finding the root cause of the problem or leads to inability to reproduce the bug in question. The goal of this presentation is to share experience of troubleshooting issues in OpenStack services during development and in production, to make developers aware of existing tools and methods for debugging typical problems.

DELIMITER - Cross Project Quota Enforcement and Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Quotas are frequently used and the same time complex piece of code that most projects in OpenStack(Nova, Cinder, Neutron) needs for proper usage and management of resources. Any project which plans to impose restriction on resource consumption would have the need for quotas functionality in near future. So given that even though quota is a common requirement there is not a common entity at present which enforces quota where as the approach taken by OpenStack is to have every project build its own quota framework  needed to enforce and manage quotas. Hence, this is an attempt to build a common entity so that new and existing projects can seek benefit from it. None of the Openstack projects that enforce and manage quotas seem to be happy about the way the Quota implementation is done for respective projects and through various mailing list discussions & project meetings its clear that some effort to fix the existing implementation would definitely help the project.

Demystifying Concurrency: debugging + performance strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Concurrent programming is one strategy to performance demands.  When is this reasonable?  When does this hit a wall, and how can you select an appropriate strategy when facing the need for speed, or when looking at existing concurrent code?  Define specifically the problem you’re observing, distill it to its essence.   Collect objective data to test your analysis and assumptions in getting to an essence.  Debug the performance issue in the essential instance, and validate.   Then, pick from the various strategies to address. We’ll walk through a specific case study.

Developing Next-Generation OpenStack Deployment Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This developer-focused presentation will outline the ongoing development of TripleO to provide an automated deployment mechanism for routed networks, also known as Clos or "spine and leaf" architecture. Spine-and-leaf archtitecture is the holy grail of network scalability. Using L3 routing switches, massive scalability is possible. Legacy networks use VLANs that span multiple racks, but spine-and-leaf shrinks the broadcast domain as small as a single rack, with routed uplinks between racks. This presentation will give an inside look into the development of spine-and-leaf network support in TripleO. In order to deploy OpenStack nodes on a routed network, TripleO takes advantage of some of the latest features in several different OpenStack projects. This presentation will detail how TripleO makes use of Heat, Neutron, Nova, and Ironic to automate the deployment of OpenStack on a routed network.

Effective Code Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Developers usually state that finding defects is the primary motivation for doing code reviews. However, research has shown that the main benefits of code reviews are; knowledge transfer, team awareness and finding alternative solutions. Code reviews when done well are more than just finding defects; it should be a discussion and conversation with other developers about finding the best solutions. We will talk about re-framing code review to encourage open discussions. This talk is for everyone that is already involved in regular code review and those hoping to start. I will talk through the code review process with the aim of making it a better and more useful experience for both the authors and the reviewers.


* **Dougal Matthews** *(  Dougal is a Pythonista based in Glasgow, Scotland. He runs the local Python user group and regularly attends and organises community events. In OpenStack he primarilly works on TripleO and Mistral.)*


Eslint rules and their purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk we will discuss what eslint is, how eslinting rules work, how to use them, and how they matter in a project. We will cover the basics of eslint and why the rules are so important, especially to a project as large as OpenStack, but in fact to any size of project. The talk will aim to equip you to leave the summit ready to advocate for or apply eslint rules to your project and understand what eslint rules are and why they matter. We will be discussing: What is eslint? Why does my project need eslint? How to set up eslint for a project Great examples of eslint rules in action


* **Beth Elwell** *(Beth Elwell is a software enginner at HPE, where she leads development of the Ironic plugin for Horizon and works on helping improve UX across OpenStack through her work on both the Horizon and Storyboard projects.

Find your Gerrit flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So you are an Openstack engineer which means you are most likely looking at a Gerrit screen on a daily basis. Gerrit is a powerful and very feature rich code review tool with a specific development workflow. It's central to our continuous integration system and we rely on it heavily to automate our workflow. Many people find that Gerrit can be a pleasure to use and others find it to be a grind on their mental health. This talk will attempt to get you out of your funk with Gerrit and get you into a more productive workflow. I will attempt to point out some Gerrit features and tools that might improve your outlook on Gerrit.  Are you aware that there are tools built around Gerrit that can help with creating patches and dashboards?  So, you don't like the Gerrit web UI?  Well I'll demo an alternative UI that you might like.  You don't like the alternative, then I'll run thru some ways you can contribute to improving Gerrit for Openstack.

Firehose: A unified message bus for Infra services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Development of OpenStack operates at a tremendous scale, with hundreds of repositories and thousands of contributors interacting continuously. The community infrastructure to support this has to operate at an equally large scale to ensure that it is not outpaced by the volume of upstream activity. Accordingly, enabling anyone to see what is happening in real time in this increasingly complex infrastructure becomes equally complex and large. This is why we need to have interfaces available to develop tooling to handle this. During the Newton cycle we introduced firehose.openstack.org to provide a unified message bus. Built using MQTT and the Mosquitto broker, firehose is a consistent interface where Infra's services can publish events. This will go over the origin and background behind the unified message bus, how it's constructed and used by Infra, and also explain the benefits to the wider community and how they can use it for their own needs, experimentation and innovation.

From Tempest to Neutron - Test migration from Tempest to OpenStack Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As OpenStack keeps growing and there's an unknown number of yet-to-come related projects, there has been a need to move API and Scenario tests from Tempest to their own projects, using tempest.lib and its stable interfaces in the process. One of the main advantages is that tests are now tied to their projects and the reviews could be directly done by developers with deep knowledge about their project, making the review process more efficient and fast. However, this process has also been proven to be challenging, as the migration implies being familiar with three key elements: Tempest Plugin Tempest.lib Stable Interfaces The OpenStack project itself In this talk we'll: Describe the current status Talk about the advantages of moving test to projects, and how to handle that Describe a real-life example about how this has been done for Neutron scenario tests and how we'll apply that experience to other projects

Full GPU virtualization support is coming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Currently, most devices can be passed through to guest and works fine, one of the exceptions is the GPU, the GPU differs from the normal PCI device, it is usually integrated with a VGA compatibility mode and OS may use the legacy VGA mode to access the GPU, so we must to emulate all of the legacy VGA mode operations in VMM.Moreover it has some features that work poorly in virtual environment, like GPU reset. we often need to reset GPU to put GPU into a clean state between guest reboot, but some GPUs lack of FLR or reset incorrect. it may not be a serious problem on physical machine, because GPU reset often occurs while machine reset. but in virtualization, we must ensure host running robust and reset GPU separately while guest reset.all the issues make GPU virtualization more complex than normal PCI devices. but now, we have a new implementation of GPU virtualization (Xengt/Kvmgt), this topic is to briefly introduce the implementation and the usage in openstack in the future.

Guerrilla TripleO for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While TripleO can seem impenetrable to anyone who does not regularly work with it, the tooling for getting up and running has improved immensely in the last year, and more and more developers are getting involved. However, given time, you will inevitably run into situations like: You have succeeded in setting up a virtual environment because you need to submit a patch, reproduce an issue or just want to try it out. But now you have to do it again for a previous release Everything is fine in a minimal setup, but now you need to add more controllers or compute instances to your setup You have two computers, and it would speed things up if you could spread your deployments across them Using the existing tools and starting-from-scratch may seem like a valid approach, but there may be a better way. In this session, we explore how you can: Take one virtual setup and turn it into many Add virtual nodes to existing deployments Add virtual nodes hosted on another server

How to do Objects in Neutron the right way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Upgrades are the everyday life of OpenStack dev/ops. As neutron is a very complex project - its requirements for upgrades from technical point of view are high. Tools developed in oslo libraries based on nova and cinder experiences have to be enhanced for neutron use-cases. Things like multiple primary keys, extendable resources sent over RPC or API, high performance of SQL queries based on ORM relationships in database model are just examples of challenges that neutron community had to face when trying to adopt oslo.versionedobjects (OVO) library. This session would explain in details how objects are handled, how to add new or port existing resources in neutron to use OVO and how online data migrations can be performed. All of this would be presented as examples in neutron code. This would be an excellent source of knowledge for neutron community members as well as for other projects that are using oslo.versionedobjects library on how difficult use-cases can be handled.

How to move toward Keystone v3: Neutron case-study
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Keystone is at the heart of an organism called OpenStack. Without it, it would be difficult to live. That's why it is important to know how to react to changes that arise from the minds of Keystone developers. Among many important changes in the v3 API for Keystone, like groups and domains, we can see the migration from the old term "tenant" to focus instead on "project". It can be painful to understand and further debug this, having become accustomed to the old usage and meaning of the term. Neutron decided to be compliant with this change and update all references to get rid of the deprecated term "tenant". Something that initially was thought to be a pretty straightforward update, turned out to be a very complex and time consuming venture. If you want to hear what kind of issues were encountered, what kind of obstacles can be expected, and if it's even worth it to pursue this goal, you'll hear all these things in this talk.

How to work in a cross-cultural environment; or, there's no word for 'please' in Finnish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We're all extremely busy making OpenStack great -- working across all time zones, spanning many different cultures and communication styles. We want to get good, solid technical work done within our projects. But due to the nature of communication among OpenStack developers, misunderstandings are going to happen. Although they may be unpleasant when they occur, we have a great opportunity to learn from them -- understanding both what happened and how to communicate more effectively next time. Culture plays as big a role as pure technical knowledge when effectively collaborating with people across the world. We don't have a set of guidelines that will solve all of OpenStack's cross-cultural communication problems, but as the great philosopher Yogi Berra said, "You can observe a lot by watching." In this panel, we'll share some stories of effective interactions we've had and will have space for you to share your stories or ask your questions, too. And we promise to explain the title!

Improving code quality with Python Type Hints for fun and profit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Python type hints are a new feature in Python 3.5 which can help to improve code quality and readability, by adding information on what type parameters and return values can be. Type hints can be directly placed in Python 3.5 or higher code, or they can be placed in separate “type hint files” for all versions of Python. There are tools in the Python community that can perform static analysis of type hints in either the source code or in type hint files. This talk will go over our experience in adding type hints to an OpenStack project and performing static analysis on the project and what we learned. Did adding Python type hints improve the quality of the code? Come and find out about type hints and how they can improve your project.

InfraCloud, a Community Cloud managed by the Project Infrastructure Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Infrastructure team, made up of contributors from multiple companies, runs the systems that support the development, testing, and hosting of OpenStack and the services that support the OpenStack community. With donated hardware and datacenter space, the team runs a private OpenStack cloud to support its automated software testing infrastructure. InfraCloud, the project born out of increasing demand from our growing developer community and a desire to "dogfood" OpenStack, is managed in the same manner as the rest of our infrastructure -- as open source, review-driven configuration. Though we've long been consumers of OpenStack clouds, running one ourselves poses new and exciting challenges. This session will discuss how we use cloud technologies to tame our hardware and how we leverage our open source infrastructure to run a cloud.

Introducing preemptible instances in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A preemptible instance is a special kind of instance that can be stopped if there are no resources available for another request with higher priority. This way a user may launch preemptible instances (probably at a fraction of the normal price) to fulfil fault-tolerant tasks (like batch processing), taking into account that they may be terminated without further advise. With the current OpenStack scheduling mechanism, instances are only spawned if there are enough available resources for. There is no way to prioritise a request against another, and there is no way a request could stop a running instance. When the computing capacity is tight, this situation lead to the underutilization of the infrastructure. This presentation will introduce a PoC for scheduling preemptible instances into nova, developed in the INDIGO-Datacloud project. With this mechanism in place the scheduler can terminate preemptible instances whenever it is needed to allocate free resources for an incoming request.

Ironic Grenade: Blowing up our upgrades.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Come and learn about the Ironic team’s efforts in making upgrade testing (Grenade) work. We will be discussing all the various obstacles and pitfalls that we ran into in getting Grenade to work for the Ironic project. Most everyone agrees that cloud upgrades need to be smooth, quick and reliable, with no downtime for data or the control plane. During the active code development processes it is very easy to break upgradability even with small changes. By adding larger features it becomes more likely. Ironic has become an actively developed project and in every release there are many new features added to Ironic. The Ironic Community decided that automated testing of upgrades was the #1 priority for Newton cycle. In this session, we will tell about the basic concepts of the testing of upgrades at the gates with help of Grenade. We highlight the difficulties faced by the Ironic team. Finally we will list what's currently being worked on and we'll look at the rolling upgrades roadmap.

Isolated development environments for OpenStack with GNU Guix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Software developers would love to live in a world where bugs are reproducible. Unfortunately, they do not: some bugs happen "in production", but not on their development machines. The behaviour of a program is indeed linked to both the packages installed on the system and the environment (environment variables, filesystem), which makes it hard to reproduce bugs. In order to get reproducible results when running unit tests, virtualenv is often used. It allows developers to create an environment that is almost isolated from the rest of the system and to install packages inside it. We will see during the presentation why virtual environments are not completely reproducible, and why they are not truly isolated. We will show how a functional package manager such as Nix or GNU Guix can help us build reproducible build environments truly isolated from the rest of the system.

Jumping on a live Grenade!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Aiming for a smoother live upgrade? Today, with your project running multiple services on different stable releases, it’s never been more important to test compatibility. As with any distributed system, it is common for OpenStack to have services running on the current release exchanging messages with services from previous releases. Without a gate to provide adequate compatibility testing, there is a possibility for a breakdown in production which will make diagnosing bugs difficult or lead to costly fixes. Implementing a partial grenade testing gate with nodes running services of different OpenStack releases can catch compatibility issues early in the development cycle. This session walks you through the steps to set up a multi-node partial grenade gate in the OpenStack CI infrastructure: Introduction to OpenStack CI Upgrade Testing: Grenade vs Partial Grenade Demo: Cinder Use Case Going from experimental non-voting to full-fledged voting job Lessons learned

Live from Oslo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A large number of changes happened in oslo libraries over the last cycle. We would like the opportunity to be able to showcase, explain, and educate contributors to what these changes are. oslo.policy  - implemented embed policy defaults in code and allow for a policy file to override them.  This would allow deployers to only configure policies that they specifically want to override. oslo.messaging(zmq) - There were zmq driver deployment configurations added like proxy and pub-sub . we'll talk about these variants of deployment and what benefits you can get using zmq driver. oslo.config - Mutable config is the ability to reload configuration (also logging configuration!) at runtime without a service restart. It is live in Nova Newton now.  oslo.messaging AMQP 1.0 driver - Introduce the new router-based messaging backend supported by the Newton release. Targetted to deployers who'd like to "kick the tires" of this backend.

Lost in a Forest of Users: Five Paths to User-Driven Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Developers can struggle to target the correct OpenStack users because they lack clearly defined user types, which creates inconsistent and confusing user experiences. We solve this problem by personifying five OpenStack user archetypes with key tasks, roles, responsibilities, and organizational models. These personas demonstrate how developers can target their work for specific audiences from the start, letting developers focus on solving problems and developing features. Join us as we define and describe five distinct user personas that can help you target your development for specific users. Our tools teach attendees to identify five user archetypes so developers can better understand users and deliver better user experiences. This promotes OpenStack adoption and improves the user experience.This session provides simple tools that focus on improving the user experience.

Making your service searchable in Horizon with Searchlight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack's Searchlight service uses ElasticSearch at its core to provide powerful, fast searching of cloud resources. Horizon now has a panel plugin that makes use of Searchlight to give you lightning-fast information about your cloud inventory. As a developer, several questions quickly emerge: How do I build plugins into Searchlight-UI for my service/component? What are the best practices for giving users a consistent interface? Do I have to rewrite my existing Horizon actions? To help answer these, we'll delve into the back-end, describing how services and third-parties can easily augment the interface provided. Although many of the UI elements are auto-generated by data retrieved from the Searchlight service, the UI may also be extended to provide maximum value to an end user. "Drawer" views in results and further detailed information may all be customized based on a simple, consolidated registration system available to both developers of core services and third-party plugins

Network Trunking in OpenStack Neutron: How to Achieve Consensus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enabling trunk ports (bp/vlan-aware-vms) in Neutron has been challenging for many reasons: it is a complex feature with several use cases we needed to take into consideration, poor performance was not acceptable, moreover a lot of attention led to long discussions. The first patch was sent for review in May of 2014. Today, October of 2016, when most of the work is done, we invite you to join us to look back and to learn from this experience. This talk will go through some anecdotes, analyze the pain points and will offer some solutions and advices on how to reach consensus. You will hear about: How we went through the various API proposals until one stuck; How we kept the Neutron API backwards compatible and technology agnostic while practically changing a fundamental premise of the Neutron network-port relationship; Why we analyzed many approaches via proof-of-concepts before picking the right one; and How we learned to better design accross OpenStack projects.

Neutron generic mechanism driver for baremetal network provisioning for multi-vendor switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Currently openstack neutron requires separate mechanism driver for plumbing various underlay switches for different vendors and protocols for baremetal servers.This abstract is to eliminate the different vendor mechanism driver implementation and make it single generic mechanism driver. In this generic driver we can initialize the appropriate vendor driver i.e third party drivers based on the user input. We have developed this using stevedore library to load the vendor driver (third party) dynamically during network configuration.In this way we can manage multiple vendor hardware switches with different protocols.we will present how to plug a new vendor driver in the existing ML2 mechanism generic drivers for network provisioning for their hardware.

Neutron L3 Flavors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron has had a modular system to load multiple drivers to provide layer 2 connectivity since Havana. This enables a single Neutron deployment to service multiple use cases (e.g. bare metal, SR-IOV, and DPDK). However, there was no mechanism to load multiple L3 drivers so operators were forced to choose a single plugin to provide routers and floating IPs for an entire deployment. To provide this capability, the concept of 'router flavors' was introduced during the Newton development timeline.  During this talk we will cover how operators and users will interact with router flavors to create routers that provide features optimized for specific use cases (e.g. deep packet inspection, high performance hardware routing, packet logging, etc) while using regular Neutron routers for everything else. We will then give a crash course on how to develop a new driver for the flavor framework to cover all of the high-level requirements for a developer to make his/her own driver.

Not sure if it’s just Cinder that is lacking in testing..or all of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Testing is critical to writing code that actually works. Openstack was groundbreaking for a large open source project in both its formalised review process and gate testing that every commit goes through. This helped the project through early stages till the current maturity level. The problem: We’ve reached the limits of the single node, quick tests. Its vendor CI’s are unreliable. Integration tests miss a variety of areas. Its in-tree and Tempest functional tests are limited. Its code coverage from unit tests is inadequate and what exists are low quality in terms of actually catching issues, and they are often an impediment to refactoring rather than an aid. Bugs slip in causing major regressions in functionality between releases. We need a new approach to testing, to augment and enhance what we already have. Unfortunately, testing falls victim to the tragedy of the commons - any company that fails to invest in it still shares the value provided by others.

OpenStack Powered: What is the ideal interoperability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Today, multiple OpenStack clouds exist and we have many cloud users in the world. Sometimes, users want to use the other cloud for the cost efficiency or the performance. Then the OpenStack interoperability is important for users, and the OpenStack foundation is providing "OpenStack Powered" program to certificate clouds' interoperability."OpenStack Powered" program is implemented by Tempest which is a test suite. On the first certification, most clouds could pass. However this year, many clouds failed due to a Tempest change. The change has been implemented by the concept of microversion mechanism.This mechanism is considered as common and good for the interoperability in the development community, however it was difficult to share this idea with whole ecosystem completely and we are facing the certification issue and working together with many folks around the ecosystem to solve that.In this session, we will talk about the ideal interoperability and the latest status of this issue.

OPNFV and OpenStack: how to leverage upstream testing tools?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OPNFV is an open source platform that uses OpenStack as the Virtual Infrastructure Layer to enable the integration of different upstream components. In OPNFV we don’t want to reinvent the wheel when it comes to testing and verification. For this reason, we try to leverage the upstream test frameworks to validate our platform from a functional point of view. This presentation will show what the upstream testing components are and how they are used and adapted to our needs.

Oslo.Messaging ZeroMQ driver update and messaging drivers benchmarking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In contrast to AMQP-based 'message broker' systems like RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ is a project that aims to create a brokerless ('zero latency') RPC mechanism for OpenStack — one that answers to the extreme requirements of very large, and/or very high-performance clouds. The current version of ZeroMQ driver (new version) has been in development since June 2015 (first spec approved) and currently supports about five different deployment architectures, each appropriate to a range of cloud requirements (large scale, high performance etc.). In this talk, we are going to explain these deployment variants, in order to help operators make good choices when using ZeroMQ as an OpenStack messaging transport. Our team has also developed a benchmarking tool to test oslo.messaging drivers and compare them with one another, exposing strong and weak aspects of each driver. We will share benchmark results obtained from different drivers and make some suggestions for how best to use oslo.messaging drivers.

Perform schema rolling  upgrades in just one release cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Reliable Openstack deployment should be as close to 100% availability as possible and always up to date with the latest release. To achieve this, during an upgrade services should be stopped and replaced with new one with noAPI downtime. In projects like keystone, glance or neutron this means keeping compatibility of DB schema between releases. The complexity of maintaining this compatibility, while keeping performance and security on a high level, is a hot topic in the community. Current approach in projects like nova or cinder requires keeping the data compatibility for 2 or 3 releases. In this presentation we want to show solutions, how to reduce the data migration time period to one release cycle. This would reduce the code complexity and performance overhead in database layer.

Scenario tests, Tempest, CI and other beasts in the Sahara world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Releasing working software artifacts is always a challenge. Releasing a huge set of projects like OpenStack increases the difficulty. Luckily, the quality assurance (QA) project has been one of the pillars of OpenStack since its inception. Still, quality is really a shared responsibility in the OpenStack community, and each project should work with the QA team to actively follow, use, and locally adapt the testing tools and guidelines.In this talk we’ll show how testing is organized in the Sahara world and performed in Sahara’s continuous improvement (CI) system. We’ll discuss the reasons for the creation of the separate Sahara tests repository and the new capabilities it allows. We’ll also share the design of the scenario tests framework itself (end-to-end), and we’ll talk about the consolidation of the Tempest-based and other high-level testing artifacts for related projects.

Service VM - speed up testing with containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Octavia (LBaaS project) use Service VM ideology. The project is using Nova to boot virtual machine responsible for serving our service - load balancer in that case. Testing projects like this require a lot of resources and time because on virtualized environment (gate) we're booting next virtual machines using Qemu as the hypervisor. Because of that, we're landing in nesting virtualization hell. Performance is horrible so testing the functionality of project is taking hours. In Octavia project after splitting tests into smaller chunks results with the testing time equal to around 1.5h. Because of that, there is the idea to use containers - LXD especially - to host and test that kind of projects and will be presented how to do this. What problems we had, identified bugs and how to use this technology in other projects.


* **Lubosz Kosnik** *(Lubosz Kosnik is a Cloud Software Engineer in OpenStack Innovation Center.

Switching to oslo.db EngineFacade in OpenStack projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

EngineFacade is a part of the oslo.db library, implemented in Kilo, which provides a simple way of declaratively defining session/transactional scope using function decorators or context managers. Despite many advantages, EngineFacade hasn’t yet been adopted by OpenStack projects except Ironic and Nova. We believe it should be. Attendees at this session will hear discussed: : Benefits of EngineFacade Challenges involved in switching OpenStack projects to use oslo.db EngineFacade How to switch: Examination of patches showing how Nova was switched to use EngineFacade They will leave with much-improved understanding of EngineFacade and ability to help their projects make the switch.

Test Tracking and Reporting with OpenStack Health
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a rather powerful and configurable platform, which provides its users with plenty of configurations options and decision to be taken when deploying a cloud. Testing such a complex system requires a lot of automation, in setting up test environments, deploying test clouds, running tests down to collecting and processing test results. Lukily the OpenStack community provides a lot tools to support quality engineering in all of these areas. In this talk I will present how to use OpenStack Health and other related technologies to collect test results from a variety of test teams and test environments, and how to use this data to help your quality organisation in tracking the status and progress of your OpenStack based software.

Testing OpenStack APIs with Gabbi and Tempest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud developers, deployers and users can use tempest to test and validate cloud APIs and services but are limited in what they can test by the clients that are built in to tempest and the existing tempest plugins. While plugins provide a useful way to extend tempest capabilities this can be cumbersome when what is wanted is a clear way to exercise or test APIs. This presentation will introduce gabbi, a toolkit for declarative testing of HTTP APIs, and show how it can be integrated, via a small plugin, with tempest to create testing scenarios from the simple to the complex in an easy to read and write YAML-based format the directly represents HTTP requests and responses. These scenarios can become permanent parts of integration suites or, because they are easy to manipulate, be created as needed for experimentation and discovery.

The challenge of running OpenStack on AArch64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running OpenStack on a new architecture for which archives are not fully built is challenging. At Linaro we started building packages for OpenStack and trying to build a developer cloud based on OpenStack a while ago. This session is about what we learnt, what we’ve done and what is left to do. We’d like to contribute gate jobs for AArch64, make sure the main distros include the relevant packages to be able to run OpenStack on this architecture and ensure developers out there get access to it to be able to debug/fix any issues in the most architecture inclusive way. We are also making sure that OpenStack on AArch64 is interoperable with other clouds.

The Gopenstack.org. rewrite. Crazy? Or just crazy enough to work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It was (correctly) decided that introducing Go as an acceptable language inOpenStack would cause community fragmentation.Monty Taylor eloquently stated:>If we want to add Go, or any other language, into the mix for server>projects, I think it should be done with the intent that we are going to>do it because it's a markedly better choice across the board, that we>are going to rewrite literally everythingCrazy right? Maybe not, let's talk about it for 45 minutes.This thought experiment will include discourse on:What could we fix? Bad architectures, data models, operations, scope, tooling, CLIs, and performance.What would it cost? Developer skill/training, new frameworks, money, time? What would (still) suck? Review time, docs, getting started, corporate interest. Can we ever fix these things?

Tour of the OpenStack Project Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every change submitted to the OpenStack project, from code to documentation, goes through a series of tests in the OpenStack Project continuous integration system. It is then reviewed and approved by members of the project and goes through a final series of tests before being merged into the repository. This presentation will guide you through some of the history and rationale for how this system works and provide a high level overview of each of the moving parts in this infrastructure. Common questions like the following and more will be covered: What is Zuul? How are test nodes made available? Where did Jenkins go? What do job configurations look like and how do they work? And much more as this presentation walks you every step of what happens when code is submitted to OpenStack.

Turning the Install Guide on its head
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At the Austin summit, there was just one burning issue in the docs camp: The Installation Guide. It had become a problem. The Big Tent changed the way that projects go about joining the OpenStack ecosystem, and with Foundation having an increased focus on ensuring new projects have sufficient documentation, the old way of writing and testing our Install Guide before each release was simply not going to scale any further. There is no ‘right’ way to install an OpenStack cloud, and there are certainly no ‘right’ components to install. But with a small docs team, and a seemingly endless parade of new projects requiring documentation, we were faced with a big technical challenge, and everyone had some kind of skin in the game.This talk covers the problems we faced, the technical and social solutions we devised, and how we implemented them. We also discuss future changes, and how the lessons learned from this project could spread into other areas of the OpenStack docs project.

Understanding Rolling Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We all have heard about rolling upgrades, but except for the people involved in the implementation most will not know how it really works. Unfortunately we cannot properly review patches or efficiently change the code base without really understanding it, since any new patch can potentially break rolling upgrades.Sure, most errors will be caught at the gate, but not only is that inefficient, but also doesn't solve everything, as now you'll have to figure out the patch's issue and a solution. And let's not forget that no CI is perfect, and some issues that fall between the cracks could be caught during reviews.This talk is meant for all developers regardless of the level of adoption of rolling upgrades within their projects, as it will not only cover the different aspects of the rolling upgrades but also go a little bit deeper into the versioned objects library explaining things like backporting, relationships, manifests, the remotable decorator, version bumping, etc.

Who Slowed Down My Cheese?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We all know the value of finding bugs as close to their introduction as possible. The time to diagnose a problem is generally inversely proportional to the age of the code that introduced it and this applies doubly for performance bugs.  Performance bugs are notorious for showing up later in the development cycle since they often require a more sophisticated environment and more than just functional tests.  As a result, these kinds of bugs often are more difficult to diagnose, more time consuming, and more costly to fix.  This talk will discuss how we at the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) have crafted a continuous integration flow using standard performance tooling to help detect performance degradations earlier than ever before.  We’ll dive into how this work is important to OpenStack upstream developers through downstream vendors and discuss how the metrics we capture will prove beneficial in establishing confidence in the stability and performance of your OpenStack cloud.

Who touched my domain? it's time to move to Identity v3!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Identity API v3 has been available since the OpenStack Grizzly release. However, its adoption hasn’t been as widespread as we in the Keystone community expected. In Mitaka, we’ve decided to mark the API v2.0 as deprecated, signaling its removal in the next releases. In this talk, we’ll show the differences between Identity API v2.0 and v3;  introduce some of the various new features included in API v3, such as domains, federation, groups, hierarchical projects and inherited role assignments; we also intend to talk about the importance of authentication sessions. Finally, we will discuss the results gathered from a users and operators survey about the Identity v3 adoption.

YAQL: The query language inside Murano, Mistral, Heat, and Fuel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

YAQL — Yet Another Query Language has been around for several years. Initially created as a data manipulation language for Murano, it has since been employed by several other OpenStack projects. YAQL is currently used by Murano, Mistral, Heat, and Fuel. YAQL is an embeddable and extensible query language that enables you to manipulate and query arbitrarily complex data structures. It grants its users the powert to perform complex queries in a single line expression. In this presentation we’re going to cover: A brief history of how YAQL was developed An overview of YAQL’s capabilities How these OpenStack projects use YAQL to manipulate complex sets of data How you can embed YAQL into your project and extend it with project-specific fundtions Where YAQL itself is heading

You don't need a policy file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Any project which wished to have policy enforcement in OpenStack has been using on the always reliable oslo.policy library. However, until recently it required that a project manually maintain and ship with a default policy file. This has placed a burden on packagers to ensure it's installed correctly, and on deployers who must manually check for additional policy rules that they should configure.   Recent changes to oslo.policy now allow for a project to register their default policies in code, eliminating the need for a policy file to be maintained. It is also possible to generate a sample policy file which is guaranteed to contain all used policies and which can be used to automate a check for new policies that have been added.   This talk will walk through how a project can take advantage of these new capabilities, and what benefits are offered to deployers when a project uses them.

Your CLI user experience matter, OpenStackClient 101
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Love it or hate it, OpenStackClient (OSC) is here to stay. Dean and Steve have been working with OSC since it's infancy and are able to discuss it's history, current status and future better than anyone. We'll give an overview of OSC's plugin framework and mention which OpenStack projects have plugins (spoiler: it's a lot!). We'll give an overview of our UX standards and the minor, but elegant UX improvements OSC has over the traditional CLIs (better error messages, bulk actions, built-in formatters). We'll also show how to use the different keystone auth plugins (Time based password, using federated identity credentials, etc) that can be used with OpenStackClient.
