Are your images Golden, Gilded, or Tarnished? Know what’s in your Glance Store.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are the images in your Glance store full of vulnerabilities? Where would you even start checking the mass of public and private images? At Symantec, we’ve built secure image management into our cloud from the beginning. Even at enterprise scale, we’re continually refining vulnerability scanning and image categorization policies. As we've moved to a hybrid cloud model, we've also built unified image management across the separate cloud providers. Development versus Production Images. Public, Private, and Community levels of visibility. All of these, and more, must be considered to ensure your images are properly secured. We will cover the following topics: How Symantec built its unified image management solution Different use cases and requirements for public, private, shared, and (coming soon) community images How to automate validation with an image release pipeline The tools to provide your users with to help them help you keep vulnerabilities from becoming security incidents
