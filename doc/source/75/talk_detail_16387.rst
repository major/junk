The Boys RBAC in Town: Facing RBAC Challenges in a Large Enterprise Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Correctly implementing and setting Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) at a large enterprise scale can be daunting; member and admin roles just aren’t enough, but it’s not easy to ensure custom roles behave across all OpenStack services and conform to the added constraints of enterprise security compliance. This talk will guide the audience through the challenges and triumphs faced in properly implementing RBAC in the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC), as well as provide insight as to the future direction of RBAC.
