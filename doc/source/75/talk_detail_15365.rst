OpenStack Hardening With TripleO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

TripleO makes OpenStack deployments easier, but for security-conscious admins, architects and engineers, TripleO presents another layer of complexity. How do you migrate from shell scripts and Puppet manifests to a TripleO-friendly deployment? In this session, we'll show you how to make TripleO an asset instead of an obstacle, and how to harden your controllers and compute nodes from the OS to all layers of the stack.

Whether it is the most efficient way to deliver an application, or how to automate a traditionally manual process, I enjoy coming up with ways to utilize the vast array of open source tools at my disposal to improve existing processes, or start a greenfield environment off on the right foot.  )*
