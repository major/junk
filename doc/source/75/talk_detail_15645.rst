What can TLS/SSL do for you?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

What can TLS/SSL do for you? There’s a 100% chance you are already using TLS/SSL to protect your public endpoints in your production cloud in order to satisfy compliance and security needs. But TLS/SSL can do much more. In this session, we’ll explore the following: Certificate-based authentication from your browser, CLI, and middleware. Hence, eliminating the need for passwords. Single sign-on (SSO) to multiple regions or clouds. Service-to-service authentication and trust using certificates. Tokenless authentication and authorization to the Keystone APIs. Deployment options. The joys and pains of TLS/SSL. There will be demos! Yes, this is a show-n-tell session. We will show what you can do today and what you can do with the patches to be submitted upstream. This is an interactive session where audience participation is encouraged and greatly appreciated.
