Secure application deployment in the age of continuous delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditionally, when datacentre operators talk about application security, there has been a tendency to focus on issues related to key management, firewalls and data access. By contrast, application developers have a security focus which is more aligned with code analysis and fuzzing techniques. The reality is, secure application deployment principles extend from the infrastructure layer through the application and include how the application is deployed. With the prevalence of continuous deployment, it’s imperative to focus efforts on what attackers’ view as vulnerable; particularly in an environment where new exploits are being disclosed almost daily. In this session we’ll present: How known vulnerabilities can make their way into production deployments How exploit impact is maximized through knowledge gaps A methodology for ensuring deployment of vulnerable code can be minimized A methodology to minimize the potential for vulnerable code to be redistributed
