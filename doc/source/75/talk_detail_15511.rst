Containers and cloud security models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the growth of the container movement and the interest from the OpenStack community in running containers, the challenges of securing the container environment are becoming more prominent â€“ indeed, according to a recent survey by Cluster HQ, 60% of respondents mentioned that security was either a major or moderate barrier to adoption. This session will look at some of the challenges around the container deployment model, and talk about approaches that can be taken as part of a wider cloud security model to protect the container environment. This will include looking at some best practices in architecting the solution, as well as securely managing the applications and interactions
