Hide&Seek - Aggressive OpenStack security for operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a rich framework that offers lots of options in configuration, architecture and technology backends. With it, there is a lenghty list of vulnerabilities and common but unhealthy practices that can be exploited. Aggressive security defense means to not only secure our environment following the standard system administration guidelines for security, but also employ penetration tools to enhance our environment defenses. OpenStack does offer an array of tactics, projects and settings that can help us reduce existingÂ vulnerabilities, provide forensic data and limit exploit damage.
