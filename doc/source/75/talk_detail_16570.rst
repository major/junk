MineMeld: An Open Source Threat Intelligence Framework for Protecting your Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Threat intelligence(TI) programs are increasingly becoming part of a robust network defense strategy to protect your cloud. Threat intelligence provides the ability to recognize and act upon indicators of advanced targeted attacks and compromise. Operationalizing and incorporating threat intelligence information into your OpenStack security infrastructure remains a challenge due to its availability via multiple information sources (open source, commercial et al), formats and lack of universal translation mechanism that can be understood by security policy enforcement points (firewalls et al). MineMeld is an open sourced extensible threat intelligence processing framework that provides organizations the ability to ingest information about various indicators from multiple sources, aggregate them and deliver them in a standardized format.
