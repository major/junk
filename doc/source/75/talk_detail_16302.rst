Encryption & Compliance: Assessors at the Gates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Security remains a major concern for companies moving into the cloud, and Compliance frameworks frequently dictate architecture and security controls for a production deployment. In this talk Mike Lange, HPE Compliance Manager, and Nathaniel Dillon, HPE Security Engineer, will look at several compliance frameworks and focus on controls that give shared assurance, focusing on privacy and encryption. Specifically, Mike and Nathaniel will look at an OpenStack deployment that is leveraging Anchor for encryption in transit, Leeson for disk encryption, and Barbican for key management. The implementation details around key rotation and scale will be highlighted to outline both where these controls are called out and how to present them to an auditor.
