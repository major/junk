Simple, Scalable, and Secure OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data is no longer confined to discrete physical servers in bunker-like data centers. With OpenStack,VMs containing sensitive data can reside on any number of physical hosts in any number of physical locations. This presents an issue, as many customers, e.g. financial or healthcare institutions, are bound by government regulations to prove that sensitive data is kept within specific geographic boundaries, and that the host running the VM is uncompromised. We’ll show how you can quickly and easily create, deploy and scale an OpenStack environment using Fuel plugins and Intel’s CIT (Cloud Integrity Technology) to establish and maintain hardware trust, and Citrix’ XenServer hypervisor to provide a verifiable host environment. Attendees will learn how hardware trust and hypervisor functionalities interlock to provide reliable security and automated policy compliance in OpenStack, and understand a toolkit for configuring, deploying and scaling trust-enabled clouds with speed and efficiency.
