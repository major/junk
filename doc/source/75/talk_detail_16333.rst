Building OpenStack Securely: Architectural Recommendations From the OpenStack Security Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Security Guide is the key reference to securely deploying OpenStack. Originally written as a collaboration between HPE, the NSA, and Rackspace, this guide has evolved with each OpenStack release and is now vital for anyone looking to deploy OpenStack in production. In this talk, Nathaniel Dillon, HPE Security Engineer and Security Guide core reviewer will step through using the Security Guide to deploy a hardened OpenStack cloud, highlighting the sections designed to assist in the architecture and planning stages, checklists for implementation and validation, and searching through the Guide for service and project-specific information when an issue arises. Nathaniel will then round up the session by covering future plans for the guide including the deploy checklists and project reviews where you can help contribute to the security of OpenStack through these specific domain sections.
