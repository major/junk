Smart Orchestration –Trusted Docker Containers with Kubernetes and Intel Cloud Integrity Technology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

App Containers are very effective way to deploy applications abstracted from the underlying infrastructure. Kubernetes is one of the key container orchestration/cluster management software of choice. Security is concern with container technology, and many app container developers have key questions like:  “Are my approved and curated set of container images launched?”,  “Are my containers running on secure servers” “How can Kubernetes use platform (Host and Docker Engine) Integrity verification while scheduling my containers"                                                                                              If these questions are interesting and relevant for your work, than this session is for you.  The session will provide a Solution Architecture (and a Live demonstration) of how to integrate platform integrity assurance and  container image integrity with Kubernetes.
