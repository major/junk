Incorporating BSIMM for OpenStack Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Security is evolving slower than its components.  Especially OpenStack software need to be robust even when it is under attack. This calls for all organizations, groups and individuals agreeing on a common ground on OpenStack software security.  BSIMM fits that bill.  As BSIMM is measuring stick for software security, it will give OpenStack developers, users, IT managers and executives a non-subjective determination of where each component of OpenStack component stand individually and collectively. As most of the leading cloud and software companies are adoping BSIMM as a measuring stick for security, OpenStack development, deployment and management community will benefit in adoping BSIMM.  As BSIMM has evolved since late nineties and in its sixth major version with data from 78 leading firms, OpenStack community can leverage this collective work that is already done.
