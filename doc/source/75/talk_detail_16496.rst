Security tools & validations for OpenStack clouds 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Enhance security levels while provisioning VMs to ensure that OpenStack services will work under hardened environments and generate a safe & reliable cloud. Certification Validation tests help in validating invalid system certificates & ensure that OpenStack services work fine when they are valid & reject requests when they expire. Token Validation: Longevity tests help uncovering bugs around token life cycle where a token expires & new token generation lead to failures. File Permissions/Sensitive Data tests to ensure that passwords & DB details are encrypted & not shown in logs. Security Hardening: Ensure that OpenStack services work in hardened environments.[Password policies,disable SSH,enforce SELinux] Best Practices: It is recommended to run the below scans against the code in order to strengthen the code at the build level and identify potential security related problems. Bandit Tool, Nessus Scan, RATs Scan, AppScan
