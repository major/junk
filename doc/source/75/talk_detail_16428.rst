Key management infrastructure in OpenStack-based Cloud/NFV deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Encryption is the foundation of OpenStack environment for enterprises moving sensitive workloads to the cloud.  Keys are used for authentication and cryptography, but can become the weakest link in securing the workload, if not well secured.  HSM (Hardware Security Module) solutions can protect the Keys in traditional environments, but are not suitable in Multi-Cloud environment, as enterprises expect to control Keys, even if the workloads are running in various clouds.  Network HSM (appliance-based HSM) come to address Key security in Cloud environments.  Secure Key Management technology for Cloud deployments go beyond network HSM, addressing not only Key security, but also high-performance secure crypto execution, by keeping the Keys in a central vault, and distributing the cryptography execution closer to the workload applications.  This session proposes an architecture for secure Key management in OpenStack-based NFV/Cloud deployments.
