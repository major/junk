OpenStack Auditing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation is intended to provide information on how the OpenStack auditing framework currently works inclusive of the support recently added over the last few releases on different non-core services; on pycadf and keystonemiddleware and exactly how auditing can be configured and used with ceilometer (including some RBAC support that was added to ceilometer couple of releases back). This is clearly for a beginner and intended for operators (cloud service providers) who need to keep track of all their audit data.
