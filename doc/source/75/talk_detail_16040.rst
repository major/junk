Recon security audit tool in OpenStack deployment and operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

HPE security released the Recon tool for system audit and hardening.I'd like to show what are the good ways to apply it in cloud deployments.Specifically, why is it useful for spot checks on existing systems and for repeated tests in the QA pipeline, and why is it useful on virtualisation hosts and guests.This also explains why is it useful to talk about Recon in context of Openstack deployment and operation.I'll talk about why did we write a new tool and how does it compare to existing, known projects.I'll also show what does/doesn't Recon do compared to other security tools like rootkit hunters, integrity scanners, vulnerability scanners - and how can they integrate.
