Digital Forensics vs. OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The growing popularity of cloud technologies with an increased degree of cloud-based virtualization creates new challenges for the investigation of cyber attacks and early incident response. The modern cloud architecture dictates the requirements for the forensic investigation and incident response model should be: Scalable Elastic Easy to integrate and manage (integration with data and control plane) To address these requirements, the paradigm of Forensics-as-a-Service has been introduced in a number of scientific papers. And digital forensic tools for OpenStack (including the FROST project), have been created to provide trustworthy forensic acquisition of virtual disks, API logs, and guest firewall logs. We will discuss: Challenges to find digital evidence in a scalable cloud environment Practices for incident response in clouds Infrastructure solutions (network sniffers, IDS/IPS, malware sandbox) How to avoid cloud service standstill during forensic investigation

* **Anders Carlsson** *(Anders Carlsson, a Swedish Navy officer in past, is an author of a course in forensics. He gives lectures in Blekinge Institute of Technology and takes a position of a general manager of the ENGENSEC (Educating the next generation of security experts) EU academic project aimed to develop security courses for the Master program.)*

* **Mariano Cunietti** *(After serving for several years as an enthusiast Linux system administrator in an ISP environment, Mariano became CTO at Enter.it and in 2011 started the company first Openstack based project running on Essex (cloudup.it and selfserver.it) On August 2013 the first italian region for EnterCloudSuite.com (ECS) was launched. It was the first public IAAS running in Italy on Openstack, one of the first in Europe. On April 2014 the German and Dutch region followed. On October 2015, EnterCloudSuite was awarded by the EU Commission to be an official provider of public IAAS to the 52 EU Institution. Before running open source infrastructure, Mariano earned a Master of Arts in Classical Guitar, and almost one in Greek and Latin Literature. )*

* **Alexander Adamov** *(At Mirantis, Alexander writes security best practices for OpenStack engineers. He moved into cloud from information security, with more than ten years’ experience in the antivirus industry working for Kaspersky Lab and Lavasoft. Alexander is also a university lecturer developing new courses for EU universities, presenting lectures and trainings that address network security, reverse engineering, and malware analysis simultaneously. At present he is researching a PhD project related to cloud security and sandboxing.  )*
