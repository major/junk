Evolution of Open Security Controller: Effectively orchestrating multiple security functions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most large enterprises enable security in their data centers by deploying multiple VNFs from different vendors to ensure that a broad range of security threats are covered. For example they will deploy vIPS, vNGFW and vADCs and enterprise operations teams face a constant challenge to manage this broad portfolio of security services and define a service function chain that ensures data center resources are protected and always up to date. The Open Security Controller has evolved over the past few months to tackle this very challenge and simplifies the task of managing security by providing a single plane of glass to orchestrate multiple security services within Openstack. In this session we will describe and demonstrate how the Open Security Controller can orchestrate multiple security services and enable security service function chaining based on the defined policy.
