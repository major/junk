PCI via Federation and Keystone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) define industry security standards around monetary transactions, specifically the handling of credit card data. There are many Identity Providers that are compliant with these security standards, and one can use Federation with Keystone to be PCI compliant. Within Keystone, you will find that we have added new PCI features in Newton. With the goal to eventually have OpenStack be PCI compliant out-of-the-box! Why is PCI DSS important?  All major credit card companies require services that process and/or store credit card data to meet PCI DSS security requirements.  Thus, if you are doing business in the cloud, you will have to meet these requirements. In this talk we shall discuss how to offload the burden of compliance with PCI DSS standards to other Identity Providers, what to do with existing user directories and how to accept the burden and still be compliant.
