Achieving end-to-end compliance based on hardware root of trust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Study shows that security is still the biggest barrier to cloud adoption, with compliance and data protection being top concerns for a CISO.    Enterprises often have a need to enforce policies (based on data sovereignty requirements) such as virtual workloads should only be placed, or migrated, based on location and assurance of hardware platform. Some others want to launch VMs/Apps/Containers on Servers with Boot Integrity – Platform Trust, while some have a need to extend the chain of trust from platform to workload (VM/Container). This session features a demo along with a reference architecture that shows end-to-end compliance (boot time to shutdown) using hardware and software attestations, as well as continuous compliance monitoring for drifts in an OpenStack cloud.
