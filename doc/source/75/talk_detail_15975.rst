Project-Independent Key Management using Open Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack continues to mature with an increasing number of security features that have the need to store secrets (e.g., encryption keys). Applying best practices for key management is a critical aspect of security. Unfortunately, the Barbican project for key management has not been widely adopted. The latest OpenStack user survey from April 2016 indicates just 2% of production deployments include Barbican. In this presentation, we introduce Castellan, a key management interface that takes the pain out of key management. We demonstrate Castellan’s seamless interoperability with Barbican and appliances that support the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) standard. KMIP is an OASIS standard for key management that is already widely used within industry. Its support in OpenStack facilitates the inclusion of existing, hardened vendor solutions for key management as has been adopted by other commercial cloud providers.
