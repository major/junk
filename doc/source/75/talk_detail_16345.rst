Security - What's New(ton)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Security Project is committed to increasing security upstream through tooling, code review, documentation, and more. This talk features Security Project PTL Rob Clark, Distinguished Engineer at IBM, and Nathaniel Dillon, Security Engineer at HPE, as they highlight the security additions for the Newton release and how they impact the community, including the new threat analysis efforts, project-specific additions, and an outline of the work that came out of the mid-cycle. Finally, they will end with current efforts and roadmaps for tools such as Bandit, and how you can increase the security and assurance of the OpenStack ecosystem across a wide range of opportunities.
