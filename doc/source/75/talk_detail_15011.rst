Identity in Tripleo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting a security-hardened OpenStack deployment is a daunting challenge. You want to integrate your TripleO deployment into your organization's existing security management toolchain. You already have a way to manage your X509 certificates for network transport layer security. You already store your user database and may expose it via LDAP and Kerberos or federate it via SAML. TripleO has a complex deployment process that is daunting to the neophyte. However, once you understand the mechanics, you can customize your TripleO deployment in many ways. You’ll also be able to security-harden your TripleO deployment with industry-standard encryption.
