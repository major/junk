* **Nathan Randall** *(Nathan works for the OpenStack IaaS group at Charter Communications (formerly Time Warner Cable) in the United States. He lives (and prefers to work) in the mountains west of Denver, Colorado.  Nathan comes to DevOps from the Operations side, having started in IT working as a VMware Cloud Engineer, Cisco Network Engineer, Linux SysAdmin, and Security Engineer. He has since seen the light and is now devoted to developing open-source applications for open-source infrastructure. He is somewhat obsessed with the idea that Information Security has been a forgotten bystander in the DevOps revolution, and he seeks to one day rectify this grave injustice. Said another way, Nathan is trying to automate his way out of ever having to talk to a compliance auditor.)*
