Security on OpenStack: Best practices from Hypervisor to Tenant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you deploy OpenStack in an enterprise as a private cloud, the deployment is usually behind a firewall and inside the trusted network with existing systems. However, when you deploy OpenStack in as public facing cloud, no assumptions can be made regarding the trust level of the domains, and the list of attack vectors increases significantly. Such attacks might result in loss of data, functionality, and reputation. In this presentation we will discuss security best practices that should be applied to each and every OpenStack cloud, public or private. We will start you off with best practices that will help you secure your Hypervisors, and show you how to enforce security across tenants by creating and enforcing policies.
