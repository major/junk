Incident response and anomaly detection using osquery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  Attendees will learn about osquery and how it can be used to actively monitor an environment. The focus will be specifically around indicators of compromise and anonomly detection within an openstack environment. Additionally I will demonstrate how to extend osquery using osquery-python and write custom query packs to detect flaws.
