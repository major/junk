Proud to be a noob: lessons learned from building a community from scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Despite all challenges from building a young community, the noob - Vietnam OpenStack Community is proudly honored to be one of the 12 official OpenStack user group in total 105 approved user groups.From 2014 to 2016, according to ACCA Cloud Readiness Index report, Vietnam is always at the bottom of the report and this becomes the biggest challenge for us to overcome. After 2 years, we have brought upstream activities and transformed them to adapt with a young community in under-developed country like transform the LEGO activities to Kirigami activities for reducing the cost of upstream training activities in Vietnam.If you are forming a new OpenStack community or having desire to extend the OpenStack activities in your community, youâ€™ll want to hear what we did, the enthusiasm we would like to collaborate with another OpenStack community in South East Asia for bringing OpenStack global event to our local region, and how you can take these lessons we learned to your own community.
