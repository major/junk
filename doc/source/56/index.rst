Home and Away: A work from home episode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the UK, the number of people WFH has increased by a fifth in the last ten years. In the US, the number of people WFH has increased 103% since 2005. Technology enables us to communicate more-or-less solely online, eradicating the need for human interaction, and allowing us to WFH on the project we love. However, with all the benefits of WFH, it can also be isolating, lonely, difficult, and a struggle. As a documenter for OpenStack, the most important thing I do every day is communicate online with people I do not know to ensure my job is conducted effectively and efficiently. Communication online is key to creating, forming, and maintaining a successful project. This presentation will cover: Consideration for working with WFH colleagues when you work in an office How maintain effective online communication between team members How to use online communication to create a good team culture with your remote team Tips on how to work from efficiently and effectively

Open Source and Cultural aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Communities involve a group of people, but what if those people have different upbring and think differently about how to approach and solve problems? Open Source projects face this every day, but usually, depending on the size of the project, some of these aspects go unnoticed... or even ignored. For large-scale projects, this affects participation and how to get people involved. Luckily there are ways to deal with this... In this presentation an overview is given about aspects that can influence the participation level. Examples are given from different perspectives. Also, solutions are given that have helped projects like OpenStack and Fedora to deal with them.

OpenStack BugSmash: Improving OpenStack and engaging new developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack became the largest open source project in the world because of a large and diverse developer community. With the maturity of the foundational projects, and a clear development methodology, it's getting even easier to learn how to contribute. So what's the fastest way to get involved? Take part in a global OpenStack BugSmash! This past spring, the OpenStack community ran coordinated BugSmash days during the first week of March in several locations around the world. This event brought experienced OpenStack committers together with community members, students, and others that were new to OpenStack or wanted to learn more. At our satellite event in New York City, it resulted in the participation of 28 local and remote attendees from 11 organizations to review and fix 51 bugs. It also generated 8 technical videos recorded for posterity. We also designed the logo, t-shirts, and stickers for the global event. Learn what worked well and what we would do better next time.

Making Meetup Magic: Growing the OpenStack Community Through Local Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Cloud Computing is much more than technology. It’s a community. And our community wasn’t built by accident! Building and growing this amazing group has been a result of the very deliberate efforts of some extremely dedicated people, as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, IRC, Stack Overflow, Google Hangout, and Twitter. Great OpenStack meetups are powerful. They foster a collaborative, inclusive environment, focused on important issues to the developers and users who make OpenStack tick.  In this continuation of a talk that began at OpenStack Summit Austin, hear what’s made four of the leading meetup organizers in the U.S. so successful and how you can translate that success to your local meetups. They’ll cover the logistics of having sponsors as speakers, explore the pros and cons of streaming live meetups, talk about how to diversify our community, and answer all of your burning questions.

From Shanghai to Global - 2016 Bug Smash!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Starting the first China OpenStack Bug Smash at Shanghai, Intel and Huawei hosted two joint 3-day OpenStack Bug Smashes in 2015 which attracted big attention of developers from 8 key OpenStack vendors, achieved totally 147 bug fixes and 44 merges. Extending the model, in March and July 2016 we including a few community partners, such as Intel, Rackspace, Mirantis, IBM, Huawei, CESI and others worked together to host a global bug smash at a few sites across four continents, in order to collaborate round-the-clock, around the world, to fix as many bugs as possible across a wide range of OpenStack projects. In the process, we also help onboard and grow new OpenStack developers, and increase our collective knowledge of OpenStack tools and processes. The session is going to give the community and the summit attendees an update about the Bug Smash, and also encourages more and more organizers to join the events to make the activities fair to all.

How can we study OpenStack well with your local user group members?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we would like to happily share meaningful lessons and tips learned from study team activities in Korea. There are more than about 5,000 people in OpenStack Korea User Group, and we had several seasonal study teams since March 2015. For about 1.5 years, approximately total 150 community members participated in offline study activities, and about 250 people joined in online slack channel to talk with study activities. We are now sure that more members in different local groups can more participate in their community activities through local study team activities. Moreover, organizing such activities needs additional ideas and thoughts such as to make balance with different study members, encourage participation, improve study satisfaction, and promote to upstream contribution. In this session, we will discuss how local user groups can make stronger and successful study teams with active members who are actively parcitipating in helping studies in Korean User Group.

Raising the awareness on diversity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Why diversity is important even if you are male, white, and even if you are old? It took me some time to understand that diversity was a really an important topic. At first, I did not understand that. I was absolutely not aware that there was a problem. The fact that we were all male, white, between 35 to 45 (it was some time ago) to make decisions seemed perfectly ok. In this session, I would like to highlight why it's important, when and why I became aware of that aspect, and how we can raise the awareness among our peers.

How We Built Fuel Community: Challenges of Big Tent projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Big Tent made it much easier to add a new project into OpenStack ecosystem. But for the program itself to be alive and successful it’s very important to build a community of developers and users around it. We at Mirantis like anyone else know how difficult it is to build a community around a Big Tent project.  We are core contributors to Fuel.  And from the project that only Mirantis was contributing to, Fuel became a 3rd popular deployment tool with a pretty large ecosystem of Fuel plugins (over 60 of them on github). In this presentation we are going to share our journey, summarize the lessons that we learned while we were building a community around Fuel and present a cheat shit of things that in our opinion is very importnant to take into account when you start building a community project.

Data Analytics & Diversity in the OpenStack Projects - Sponsored by Women of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A popular talk in OpenStack Austin was about openstack contribution anslytics.  It shared the actual state of gender based technical contributions in OpenStack projects[1]. It spurred further questions from attendees on improving the accuracy of the numbers and extending the analysis to look for best practices in diversity. We will talk about best practices in OpenStack projects that make them more diverse. And this is also an issue for the organizations involved in the development of such projects. This talk will present an update of the numbers presented in Austin [1].   The analysis will focus on technical contributions (git and gerrit activity mainly) with a quantitative approach, but also add a qualitative approach to understand why the differences in terms of diversity within the Foundation exist.  [1] https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/8723

A dice with several faces: Coordinators, mentors and interns on OpenStack Outreachy internships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most open source projects do a poor job of onboarding new contributors. Proper onboarding enables a new contributor to make bigger contributions, more quickly, and increases how long they will stay involved. This process is especially challenging in open source and worldwide communities where different cultures collide. In this talk you will learn about the Outreachy program in OpenStack and how having a good mentor can help newcomers in overcoming the obstacles smoothly. This talk is intended for people willing to start contributing or mentoring and for those willing to become a better community member. In this presentation we will share the experience from one of the coordinators, one of the mentors and one on the interns of the last Outreachy round, hoping to clear doubts on how this kind of internships work, what is the added value to the community, what is expected from mentors and what is expected from mentees.

Tips & Tricks to Launching an OpenStack Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Community groups are a great way to learn about OpenStack! Local OpenStack meetings provide a venue for beginners to get their feet wet and experienced OpenStackers to share insights and thoughts in an open and social atmosphere. This is a chance to learn what's involved and learn from others experience starting up a community group. We'll be going through our experiences and passing along tips and tricks getting a local OpenStack (San Diego) group off the ground. This includes finding compelling content (speakers, demos, and activities) as well as promoting and marketing the group through various channels to draw in an audience. Setting up a small OpenStack lab for a hands-on meetup isn't that tough when you know some secrets. Sponsorships help legitimize a group and fund important things like beer and pizza. Companies can be quick to sponsor when you explain the benefits. We'll also discuss resources that the OpenStack Foundation has available for community groups.

Lesson learned from organizing developer teams in user group: how to help each other.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are more than about 5,000 people registered at Korea community. Among them, not many people can develop or have an experience of operating OpenStack. It is really difficult to keep openstack developers' passion and activity in community (outside of company's work). In addition, as a developers in Korea, I often felt difficulties to participate openstack developer community due to the language barrier, time differences, cultural difficulties to share information outside of company, etc. Thus, we thought a developer meetup is great idea to follow up. As a result, Korea community is running developer meetups for 6 month now. We did write specs, analyzed code, tested new project, etc. all together. It created real momentum among developers to continue its road to openstack developers, as well as motivated them to share with others. We will share our experiences to run this developer-focused meetups.

100% Organic Talkshow Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Content Marketing in the OpenStack space is a tough calling. How do you produce technically deep (yet amusing), well-structured (and yet unexpected), workpersonlike (and yet whimsical) video programming for savvy, demanding, pretense-averse OpenStack viewers? The answer is … well, basically, Agile. You create structure and momentum by adopting ruthlessly minimalistic process, then improvise within that structure to create spontaneity and insight. That's the formula Nick Chase and colleague John Jainschigg, both of Mirantis, have used to create several dozen episodes of the OpenStack: Unlocked Podcast — a long-form video talk show featuring interviews of OpenStack industry visionaries. In this presentation, Nick and John discuss their process, techniques, and their 'expert-curated, crowdsourced' model for new content development, with an eye to helping other OpenStack communicators produce more useful content, faster, with less pain, strife, cost and self-doubt.

Are Bug Bashes Sexy? Productive?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It all started more than a year back in China with Intel and Huawei co-hosting a bug bash which morphed into a 3-day global bug bash for Mitaka running at 13 sites and local events for Newton. In India the event attracted OpenStack newcomers who were welcomed with 101 sessions. In China, Australia,  and USA seasoned PTLs and Cores hosted the events and teams focused on bugs in different areas, many of them critical, high, and medium in value. The sense of urgency from an impending release, the camaraderie of working together are special. Coupled with the stellar statistics in bugs addressed, fixed, reviewed, and merged shows a community that is vested in producing a quality product. We share in this talk the projects that benefitted and provide statistics on bugs addressed and resolved, tips on hosting a bug bash from how early to start, date selection, minimum requirements, places to advertise the event and more. Please consider hosting a bug bash for the next release!!

Meetups and User Groups: How Cross-Pollination of Communities Leads to Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ansible, an open source project frequently used with OpenStack, is known (amongst other reasons) for its rapid growth as a community. With more than 17,000 stars on GitHub, and over 180 meetup groups around the world, it's pretty easy to find someone you know who likes Ansible! But at some point, growing the attendance or potential audience of any user or meetup group can be difficult, and can be even tougher in smaller or less densely populated cities. And ensuring that meetups grow and evolve is key to their ongoing success -- and ultimately, part of the project's success. The Ansible community has discovered successes in locating and finding other meetup groups in which to branch out - including OpenStack meetups! In this session, Robyn Bergeron, Community Architect for Ansible, will share some of her lessons learned in growing and cross-pollination of the Ansible community with other communities. 


* **Robyn Bergeron** *(As Ansible's Community Architect, Robyn Bergeron focuses on building bridges between Ansible and other open source communities, as well as steadily scaling Ansible's framework for collaboration and contribution as the community continues to grow.
