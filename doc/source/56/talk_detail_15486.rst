* **Lana Brindley** *(Lana Brindley has several university degrees, a few of which are even relevant to her field. She has has been playing and working with technology since she discovered the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy text adventure game in the 80's. Eventually, she worked out a way to get paid for her two passions – writing and playing with gadgetry – and has been a technical writer ever since. Right now, she’s working for Rackspace from her home in Brisbane Australia, getting her hands dirty on cloud documentation, and loving every minute of it. She is passionate about open source, cake decorating, and great docs, and is raising her very own geek girl. One day, Lana hopes to write the manual for that, too.)*
