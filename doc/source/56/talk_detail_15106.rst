Open Source and Cultural aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Communities involve a group of people, but what if those people have different upbring and think differently about how to approach and solve problems? Open Source projects face this every day, but usually, depending on the size of the project, some of these aspects go unnoticed... or even ignored. For large-scale projects, this affects participation and how to get people involved. Luckily there are ways to deal with this... In this presentation an overview is given about aspects that can influence the participation level. Examples are given from different perspectives. Also, solutions are given that have helped projects like OpenStack and Fedora to deal with them.
