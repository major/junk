**Abstract:**

Content Marketing in the OpenStack space is a tough calling. How do you produce technically deep (yet amusing), well-structured (and yet unexpected), workpersonlike (and yet whimsical) video programming for savvy, demanding, pretense-averse OpenStack viewers? The answer is … well, basically, Agile. You create structure and momentum by adopting ruthlessly minimalistic process, then improvise within that structure to create spontaneity and insight. That's the formula Nick Chase and colleague John Jainschigg, both of Mirantis, have used to create several dozen episodes of the OpenStack: Unlocked Podcast — a long-form video talk show featuring interviews of OpenStack industry visionaries. In this presentation, Nick and John discuss their process, techniques, and their 'expert-curated, crowdsourced' model for new content development, with an eye to helping other OpenStack communicators produce more useful content, faster, with less pain, strife, cost and self-doubt.
