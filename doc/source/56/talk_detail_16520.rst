Your new Superpower – workin’ the room at the OpenStack Summit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Chances are your company has spent a lot of money to get you to the OpenStack Summit and you’ve have some quality time in a cramped car, plane or train to get here.  Don’t make the OpenStack summit a waste of time and money.  Your potential partners, customers and employers are all here and waiting to hear what you have to say.  Don't stand in the corner and talk to your co-workers - walk into demo room, cocktail party or community event, meet the people you want to meet and make magic happen.
