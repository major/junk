Lesson learned from organizing developer teams in user group: how to help each other.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are more than about 5,000 people registered at Korea community. Among them, not many people can develop or have an experience of operating OpenStack. It is really difficult to keep openstack developers' passion and activity in community (outside of company's work). In addition, as a developers in Korea, I often felt difficulties to participate openstack developer community due to the language barrier, time differences, cultural difficulties to share information outside of company, etc. Thus, we thought a developer meetup is great idea to follow up. As a result, Korea community is running developer meetups for 6 month now. We did write specs, analyzed code, tested new project, etc. all together. It created real momentum among developers to continue its road to openstack developers, as well as motivated them to share with others. We will share our experiences to run this developer-focused meetups.
