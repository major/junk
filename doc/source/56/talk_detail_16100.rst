**Abstract:**

You're an OpenStack professional with a deep understanding of several components and have loved contributing back to the community over the years. When suddenly, you need to find a new job. Opportunities abound, but taking advantage of them may not be as simple as it seems. As a developer, are you prepared to do whiteboard coding and discuss the algorithmic complexity? As an operator, are you prepared to explain best practices and showcase your troubleshooting skills?

And to snag your OpenStack dream job, you'll need to come prepared. Brad and Tim have a combined 9 years of experience interviewing candidates, with several focusing exclusively on OpenStack. Join us to learn what technical interviewers are looking for so that you're prepared to take full advantage of your next opportunity.
