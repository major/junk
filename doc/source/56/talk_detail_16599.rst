Meetups and User Groups: How Cross-Pollination of Communities Leads to Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ansible, an open source project frequently used with OpenStack, is known (amongst other reasons) for its rapid growth as a community. With more than 17,000 stars on GitHub, and over 180 meetup groups around the world, it's pretty easy to find someone you know who likes Ansible! But at some point, growing the attendance or potential audience of any user or meetup group can be difficult, and can be even tougher in smaller or less densely populated cities. And ensuring that meetups grow and evolve is key to their ongoing success -- and ultimately, part of the project's success. The Ansible community has discovered successes in locating and finding other meetup groups in which to branch out - including OpenStack meetups! In this session, Robyn Bergeron, Community Architect for Ansible, will share some of her lessons learned in growing and cross-pollination of the Ansible community with other communities.
