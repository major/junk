Come one come all! If you’re an cloud application developer, architect, cloud operator, or a business/marketing member of the community who is interested in helping OpenStack to be the leading cloud solution, please come join this discussion on what the barriers are for application deployment today and how we can remove them. Tell us what are the roadblocks, issues, or requirements for developing cloud aware applications to deploy on OpenStack today.
