OpenStack BugSmash: Improving OpenStack and engaging new developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack became the largest open source project in the world because of a large and diverse developer community. With the maturity of the foundational projects, and a clear development methodology, it's getting even easier to learn how to contribute. So what's the fastest way to get involved? Take part in a global OpenStack BugSmash! This past spring, the OpenStack community ran coordinated BugSmash days during the first week of March in several locations around the world. This event brought experienced OpenStack committers together with community members, students, and others that were new to OpenStack or wanted to learn more. At our satellite event in New York City, it resulted in the participation of 28 local and remote attendees from 11 organizations to review and fix 51 bugs. It also generated 8 technical videos recorded for posterity. We also designed the logo, t-shirts, and stickers for the global event. Learn what worked well and what we would do better next time.
