How can we study OpenStack well with your local user group members?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we would like to happily share meaningful lessons and tips learned from study team activities in Korea. There are more than about 5,000 people in OpenStack Korea User Group, and we had several seasonal study teams since March 2015. For about 1.5 years, approximately total 150 community members participated in offline study activities, and about 250 people joined in online slack channel to talk with study activities. We are now sure that more members in different local groups can more participate in their community activities through local study team activities. Moreover, organizing such activities needs additional ideas and thoughts such as to make balance with different study members, encourage participation, improve study satisfaction, and promote to upstream contribution. In this session, we will discuss how local user groups can make stronger and successful study teams with active members who are actively parcitipating in helping studies in Korean User Group.
