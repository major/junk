How We Built Fuel Community: Challenges of Big Tent projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Big Tent made it much easier to add a new project into OpenStack ecosystem. But for the program itself to be alive and successful it’s very important to build a community of developers and users around it. We at Mirantis like anyone else know how difficult it is to build a community around a Big Tent project.  We are core contributors to Fuel.  And from the project that only Mirantis was contributing to, Fuel became a 3rd popular deployment tool with a pretty large ecosystem of Fuel plugins (over 60 of them on github). In this presentation we are going to share our journey, summarize the lessons that we learned while we were building a community around Fuel and present a cheat shit of things that in our opinion is very importnant to take into account when you start building a community project.
