PTLs and Cores: We are Not as Scary as You Think - Sponsored by the Women of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Assemble a panel of select PTLs and Cores who value diversity and inclusion to share their experiences coming up through the ranks within the OpenStack Community and offer guidance to new OpenStack Community members. "We Aren't as Scary as You Think" is aimed at newer members of the Community who may be too intimidated to engage in a dialog with more senior Community leaders. The PTLs and Cores will share their experiences on how they scaled the OpenStack learning curve as a way to help accelerate on-boarding new members into the Community.
