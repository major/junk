Building a private cloud with Openstack and Nuage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In 2013 Santander committed to embrace private cloud in an effort to improve IT delivery lead times and consolidate infrastructure resources in line with the company's devops adoption strategy. Being a worldwide financial institution with datacenters in 5 different location across different continents posed no small challenges on infrastructure and network design. We will share with the community the challenges we faced, how they were overcome and the reasons we opted for Openstack and Nuage VSP as key enablers to achieve success.
