Openstack in Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack has already been designed with microservices in mind and now the time has come to start using it as designed. Deploying openstack components within a microservice architecture framework will allow you to scale, recover from disasters, redeploy and upgrade with ease. Containerizing these micro services will allow you to test and even deploy from the latest and greatest code from community, such as new features can be thoroughly checked before being rolled out to your production cloud.
