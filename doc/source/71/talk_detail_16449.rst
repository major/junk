Cockpit and OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Some organizations need server admin interfaces for diverse reasons, currently there are lots of options but they all need some level of configuration, are too complex and/or use a considerable amount of resources. Cockpit is an interactive server admin interface. It comes “out of the box” ready for the admin to interact with the system immediately. It can manage multiple servers from a central interface with very little effort. Cockpit is a good choice for managing OpenStack nodes since it has nearly zero footprint, it starts on demand via socket activation and exits when not in use, leaving more system resources available for the OpenStack services. In this talk we'll address a proof of concept OpenStack multinode installation using Cockpit as the bare metal admin interface and compare its resource use with a TripleO installation.
