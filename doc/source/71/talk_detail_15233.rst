OpenStack on Raspberry Pi: One Byte at a Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Deploying an OpenStack cloud across multiple Raspberry Pi computers.  The idea that using multiple credit card sized computers that cost about $35 each to run an OpenStack cloud seemed like an intriguing idea.  The actual feasibility of it needed to be tested.  There are a few blog posts that describe the general idea; however, most of them were outdated and did not include the latest version of the Raspberry Pi, the Pi 3.  Using a cluster of these devices, we set out to see how feasible it would be to deploy OpenStack using only Raspberry Pi devices.  In total, between two of us, we had a Raspberry Pi 1, two Pi 2s, and several Pi 3s. Our goal: To set up OpenStack on these minimal devices, across the internet in two physical locations.
