The Private Cloud Service Provider Blueprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building a Private Cloud business is hard! Don't be fooled. OpenStack is only one piece of the cloud provider puzzle. There are business considerations and technical components required such orchestrators, billing systems, and application catalogs that must all be considered to do it right. If you are faced with the daunting challenge of planning your business this is the session for you. Canonical has created a blueprint for private cloud service providers that can be followed which describes what it takes to move forward with your business plans. Attendees will follow along as we build out a fictional private cloud service provider using our service provider blueprint developed by the Consulting Architecture team. You will gain an understanding of not only the technical aspects of the service provider blueprint but also gain an understanding of the challenges that cloud providers need to solve before realizing their full potential.

We do this by providing open source software that allows for model-driven operations of "big software".   )*
