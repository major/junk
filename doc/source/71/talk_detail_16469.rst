Using Monitoring to Guide Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most cloud platform (and workload) migration stories start with expert knowledge (and surmise): about how apps work, how workloads are assembled, their dependencies, requirements and characteristics. But as cloud environments become more dynamic, apps and instances more numerous, and patterns of utilization more diverse, it makes sense to back up this technical understanding with empirical performance data and dependency analytics — to highlight candidates for migration, assist in migration planning, and provide performance baselines for predicting migration impacts. This is made possible by analytical monitoring tools that work across multiple cloud platforms, enabling parallel examination of multiple clusters, perhaps some remote and others local/on-premise — all through a single operator pane of glass. In this session, we'll present and demonstrate best-practice for using such tools to accelerate migration to OpenStack from other infrastructures.
