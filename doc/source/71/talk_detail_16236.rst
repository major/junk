Neutron Mechanism Drivers: What to Ask Your Vendor​
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Do you use OpenStack deployment with a networking solution that is notthe reference implementation? Do you care for a stable and robustsolution?  If you do, you should ask your vendor how it handlesA-Synchronous invocation of networking backend, how does it handle outof sync resources and how does it report back errors to Neutron.In this session we’ll discuss why you care about these questions, whatstands behind them and why they are so important. We would also coverthe way these challenges are handled in OpenDaylight, in OVN and inDragonFlow, all open source solutions.
