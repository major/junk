How OpenStack googlifies the data center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is today’s most widely used and fastest-growing cloud infrastructure technology. It helps build and manage private, public, and hybrid clouds that ensure reliable, scalable, and flexible services – all while reducing operational overhead. But in order to truly succeed, basing all the data center parts in software is essential or at least highly beneficial. Behind this thought is the googlification of the data center: running software on commodity hardware allows for massive increases in utilization and leads to a significant drop in operations overhead. Based on the Google and Amazon role model, Felix will give an outline of said evolution and claim that OpenStack is a major driving force in the process but is only complete when making good on the ”software-defined“ promise.
