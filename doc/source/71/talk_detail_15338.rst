Keep up with the pace: How to smoothly adapt API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack have been evoluted for 14 releases, the API of each services have been changed more or less, some of them bumped from v1 to v2, some of them adopted the microversion mechanism, some of them deprecated or planning to deprecate extension machanisms; What can we learn from the changes? How can we quickly keep up with the changes as cloud users and downstream vendors? This topic will discuss the API change history of Nova, Cinder and Neutron, ilustrate and compare the way APIs evoluted in these projects, what kind of problem did our customers meet and what did we try to quickly adapt to the changes in our downstream development, this session will also try to compare the pros and cons for each kind of changes in the cloud users' and downstream vendors' point of view;
