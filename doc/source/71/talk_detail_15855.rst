**Abstract:**

In the OpenStack Summit Tokyo, we've reported how DevOps works in our project ( http://bit.ly/2a8atnJ ) and what kind of operations are performed behind our private cloud system ( http://bit.ly/29Dw8FW ). Over the first stage of launching private cloud system, now we are aiming to migrate various systems included NTT DOCOMO's basic operation systems to our private cloud. To gather various systems into the one private cloud system enable us to reduce total cost of ownership. Today, We talk our strategy and technical knowledge to expand and deepen our private cloud for the migration.
