Yo dawg I herd you like Containers, so we put OpenStack and Ceph in Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, you'll learn how OpenStack is evolving to integrate with the Linux, Docker, Kubernetes stack to provide the ideal infrastructure platform for modern containerized applications. You'll learn how you can modernize application delivery using container infrastructure while seamlessly using the authentication, network, and storage services provided by the underlying OpenStack cloud. We'll also discuss the ways that the Linux, Docker, Kubernetes stack is improving the deployment and management of the life cycle of the underlying infrastructure platforms themselves, focusing on OpenStack and Ceph.

* **SÃ©bastien Han** *(Sebastien Han currently works as a Principal Software Engineer, Storage Architect for Red Hat. He has been involved since 2011 with OpenStack and Ceph and has built a strong expertise around these two technologies. Curious and passionate, he loves working on bleeding edge technologies and always hope to find a suitable spot to integrate his two favorite technologies. In 2013, he started to work with containers and ultimately implemented containerised Docker Ceph services. On a daily basis, he loves to rotate between these three areas where he always makes sure to strengthen the integration between all of them. From time to time, he attends various summits and events where he evangelises these technologies and their usage. In addition, he always devotes a third part of his time to blogging. But this... is just the beginning :).)*
