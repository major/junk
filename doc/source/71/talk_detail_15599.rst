The Road to Production Grade (lessons learned from our experience with Dragonflow)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Dragonflow is a young project, barely two years old.  We have been working hard at making it a good candidate for users that need a networking implementation that can scale to 10,000 hosts, and allow hosts with 10Gbps NICs to be fully utilized, even when running an overlay network with encap/decap.In this session we will share some of our experience and lessons learned while getting Dragonflow ready to handle such loads in Huawei's Enterprise Cloud:* Database Consistency in OpenStack Components* Publish Subscribe: Broker vs. ad-hoc vs. mesh (Peer-2-Peer)* Performance Maximisation and Testing Results
