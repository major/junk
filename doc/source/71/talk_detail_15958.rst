Openstack cloud sizing made easy: A simple openstack sizing tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this topic we will discuss the issues of translating typical customer cloud requirements into factors to be considered for designing an enterprise grade cloud. This helps cloud architects to understand the key considerations to taken into account while sizing. The session introduces a potential sizing tool to come up with the amount of hardware needed for the control and compute planes of the target openstack cloud. The sizing tool is built based on collective experiences gained in several sizing exercises. The tool takes in customers’ requirements as input and has the flexibility of letting the user configure values of the design parameters. The output would be approximate amount of hardware needed for the control and compute plane as well as block and object storage if needed.
