Modularity in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack cloud is usually provided by a single vendor that ensures the interoperability and compatibility of the cloud services. As a result, cloud users (or even vendors of parts of the cloud) need to rely on the cloud provider to include services, OpenStack updates and extensions whenever those are needed. If the functionality of an OpenStack service that is not part of the cloud is crucial for the user, they can try to run the given service in a standalone mode and deliver it with their product. This setup involves all the operability, security and other aspects of delivering an OpenStack service. In this presentation, we argue for a more fine grained service provision setup and we show practical architectural patterns that make the extension of existing OpenStack services easier and practical.
