Evaluating OpenStack Network Architectures at Scale (Armchair Not Included)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

On an average day, AT&T is transiting 114 petabytes of data across its network.  This has required that we carefully evaluate how we build and operate our networks especially within our OpenStack environments where NFV deployments are growing rapidly.  Choosing a particular approach has lasting consequences and today there are more OpenStack network architectures and plugins than at any time in the past.   How do you choose an architecture, plugin, and set each of the many tunable parameters correctly for your organization? You’ll learn how we approached systematically comparing, benchmarking, ranking, and stress testing network plugins and architectures available in OpenStack including options such as OpenContrail, DragonFlow, OVS+SFC, and more.  We’ll review the tools we leveraged, and finally discuss our criteria for ultimately selecting the correct strategy for our organization and our complex NFV needs.
