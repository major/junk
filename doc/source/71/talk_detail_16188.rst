Providing a Geo-Redundant Application Cloud with OpenStack and Cloud Foundry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

An examination of the architecture and implementation of Swisscom’s Geo-Redundant Application Cloud (‘MultiCloud’).  A common request from customers migrating legacy applications to cloud native workloads is for a transparent solution which provides effective 100% application availability through geo-redundancy (Geo-Redundancy as a Service).  Swisscom solves this problem with a combination of networking, OpenStack and Cloud Foundry.  The architecture and implementations of our solution will be discussed, along with problems and solutions encountered along the way.
