The glory and fallacies of abstraction APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The usage of abstraction APIs significantly reduces the effort of integrating one application with the cloud or services of the cloud. The talk will cover several abstraction APIs used to access the cloud or the NFV ecosystem. Several examples will be provided that show the limitations of using abstraction APIs in real world scenarios. The talk will aim to collect the main aspects that an architect should consider before choosing the "right" API.
