Taking OpenStack towards a hyperconverged future.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There has been a few very popular reference architectures of OpenStack that have changed throughout the different releases of OpenStack, but remained very much closely tied to the original formula.  At VEXXHOST, we've worked on building out a far more efficent and faster reference architecture which we've deployed many times for our customers successfully. This architecture is a hyper-converged setup where you can combine both storage and compute on the same node.  It's always been a big no-no to do this, but times have changed and this new architecture works and it's been proven in production.   This starts the discussion of perhaps moving to a new reference architecture for OpenStack.
