Ironic as a data center appliance & equipment manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A project just now ripening to maturity, Ironic is your best bet not only to manage bare-metal instances but also to manage non-OpenStack equipment and their networks. Ahmed Rahal and Philippe Godin will explain how to manage bare metal inventory using the Ironic dashboard, how to push network models and configurations, and how to deliver a publicly exposed—yet secure—server.

* **Philippe Godin** *(After years of trying to make radar systems detect Pokemons, Philippe decided that doing pings with real things was not for him. Being the developer he is, he knew he had to work for a company that would take ping seriously. Currently one of the lead of Internap's Ironic effort, and heavily involved in its open-source effort, Philippe is proud to have helped his team release one of the first public Bare Metal product based on OpenStack)*
