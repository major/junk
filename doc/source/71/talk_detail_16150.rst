Application-Aware Data Protection … Virtualization is not Enough
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack environments need robust data protection—something more than just cobbling together scripts or relying on virtualization. This presentation will cover how OpenStack environments benefit from intelligent data protection, such as:   Scaling as the application grows   Efficient Storage   Point-in-time Recovery/Orchestration   Tech Refresh (Use Cases: Upgrades, Disaster Recovery or Data Mobility)   Application Consistent backup   Covering compliance requirement needs
