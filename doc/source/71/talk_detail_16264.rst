OpenStack and DC/OS, worlds colliding or merging?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the common questions around OpenStack is “What’s the best way to run cloud native workloads on, or with, OpenStack”. Though OpenStack is the leading open source cloud platform, it’s mostly targeted for more traditional workloads running on bare metal or in VMs.Based on Mesos, DC/OS  is an open source data center OS, designed for running those cloud native and big data workloads at massive scale, efficiently solving the hard problems around cloud native scheduling and clustering.If squarely on one side or the other, your life is pretty easy. For those of us that have a wide variety of workloads, figuring out how to get the best of both worlds can be somewhat challenging.In this session we’ll explore the benefits from running OpenStack and DC/OS together and the use cases and scenarios where this bring the most value.We’ll take a look at the integration work we’ve done in this area and how it can be applied to maximize the benefit in heterogeneous environments.
