Openstack and Kubernetes: One on Top of the Other, Vice-versa, or Sideways?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack and Kubernetes are leading management platforms in their respective areas: the former for general infrastructure and virtualization, the latter for containers orchestration. For the growing number of organizations that have decided to take advantage of both, a question arises: what is the best way to architect and integrate the two stacks? Historically, the safe answer seemed to be to deploy Kubernetes clusters "on top" of Openstack, using solutions such as Heat, Murano, or Magnum. Recently though, an alternate pattern is emerging: use Kubernetes as a base layer, and deploy Openstack as an "application" on it. What are the advantages of such an approach? Furthermore, a company may have deployed independent Openstack and Kubernetes stacks due to historical or organizational reasons. How can the company integrate the two to leverage their respective strengths? Finally, is it possible to use Murano as a unified catalog for both both Openstack and Kubernetes-based applications?
