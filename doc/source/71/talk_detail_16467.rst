Building better autoscaling applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

While autoscaling is one of the most desired features for cloud native applications,the utilization of Cloudwatch or Ceilometer proved it underperforming, with longtimeouts that don't meet the user requirements and a metering architecture difficultto run efficiently on a large scale.Using the new features from Mitaka and the combination of projects like Monascafor instance monitoring, Heat for automation and Octavia for an elastic load balancerL7 Switching features, we can automate and scale our applications using real timealarm processing and proper load balancer integration. We can go further and once available, we will be able to provide self-healingbased on the Monasca-log-api alarms.In this session we will see how to build a production cloud application thatautoscales using Monasca alarms, Heat integration, Octavia load balancing andBarbican TLS support.
