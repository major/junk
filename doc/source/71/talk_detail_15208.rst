Scaling your cluster with more flexibility, efficiency and reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scaling is an important capability of cloud platform. Either auto or manual, users usually need to adjust their resource pool capacity to adapt to the change of workload. However, scaling is not just simply increasing or decreasing the size of cluster. Lots of issues need to be thought over to ensure the scaling progress is efficient, reliable and flexible enough to fulfill the demand of patical usage. In this presentation, we will deep dive into the (auto)scaling design of Senlin project and use real case to demonstrate how to reduce the overhead caused by nodes creating/deleting, how to make scaling flexible, and how to hanlde exception to make the scaling progress recovable and rollbackable.

During his school time, he focus on IPv6 and IPv4 translation technicals, and help to build experimental IPv6/IPv4 translation router on BUPT CERNET2 node. During his work in IBM, he helps to build up IBM cloud production based on openstack, and help design and deliver HighAvailability solution for openstack services. He contributes lots of codes and reviews to openstack projects, especially heat and senlin project, and receive open source recognition award from IBM.)*

He is now contributing to several Openstack projects, including Senlin, Zun/Higgins, Heat, Ceilometer and also working on business solutions that related to private cloud. Currently, he is focusing on continuous service deployment and management cross multiple region/cloud and hybrid cloud environment, especially autoscaling related topics.)*
