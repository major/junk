Big Brother is watching you! Or how to audit the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operating big public clouds opens a wide stack of challenges and security requirements to architects, cloud operators and all members of public cloud vendor team. Each user step should be verified and tracked to avoid intrusions or/and to have a chance to identify actions sequence that may have caused some issue or led to an unpredictable situation. A cloud audit enables you to monitor who, when, where, why and how actions were taken in the cloud environment. In this presentation we will describe our experience of implementing a CADF based audit, and overview cloud performance measurements, the decisions we made and which solutions we had to reject and why.
