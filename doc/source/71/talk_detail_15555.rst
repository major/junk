What are you waiting for? Using SDX + OpenStack for your private cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It would be a waste to use OpenStack only for managing resources because OpenStack can serve as the heart of whole your system management. Both SDN and SDS provide incredibly powerful architecture, especially when combined. You can completely integrate your network, storage and computing resources by using SDN/SDS with OpenStack. Now is the time to start using what will certainly be new standard. More specifically, we are using Big Cloud Fabric and Ceph as SDN/SDS in our production environment. Big Cloud Fabric is an especially unique SDN controller with its flexibility to support underlay networks. All combined, this setup allows us to manage our private cloud more efficiently than ever before. This session will explain how we integrate SDX with OpenStack and the potential benefits. It will hopefully provide some valuable hints for increasing the efficiency of your own private cloud.
