Architecting OpenShift on top of OpenStack at Produban
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation Produban will describe the architecture for its Global PaaS solution. The session will start with an overview of the desired business and technical outcomes Produban (IT group behind Grupo Santander) wanted to achieve to setup its PaaS environment. Quickly the session will dive into the architectural details of the chosen OpenStack and Network Architecture that underpin Produban's OpenShift V3.X docker cluster. It will be shown how Nuage Networks SDN features are used for advanced networking configuration across OpenStack and OpenShift, and how the PaaS solution can be scaled out in a big and complex production environment.
