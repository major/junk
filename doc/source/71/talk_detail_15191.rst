Architecting An Enterprise-Grade Cloud Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Most enterprises don't plan for Multi-Cloud, Multi-Cloud organically happens as one departement deploys OpenStack and another adopts a public cloud. Finding a balance between the needs of multiple enterprise consituencies while leveraging the benefits of a Multi-Cloud environment is proving to be a challege. This talk will explore the "Enterprise-Grade Cloud Stack" and will provide an overview on how today's enterprises approach a Multi-Cloud strategy, what role does OpenStack play, and what are the types of tools that are available to tackle some of the common challenges.

After I realized my passion lies with technical evangalisim I started doing techical training full time. My training position led me to other opprotunities such as QA testing and Product Design, while always finding way to talk about the product, platforms and technologies I was passionate about. I currently run Product Marketing for Scalr, the enterprise-grade cloud management platform. As an active user of multiple cloud platforms, this position allows me to remain hands-on and technical with operations work and have discussions and tell stories about technology at the same time.  Also, I have a YouTube channel where I talk about TV shows :))*
