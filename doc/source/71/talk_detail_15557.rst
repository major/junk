Service Continuity with OpenStack Smaug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the main concerns of online businesses is ensuring service continuity in case of a major outage.  Most of the protections provided today deal with data replication from one site to the other, but is it enough? Most production environments have considerable amount of configuration, scripts, security settings and metadata, which accumulates. This metadata is not protected in case of a site disaster. OpenStack Smaug protects all the data which comprises a working environment.  It orchestrates protection plans and calls protection providers for each of the various protectable items in your environment, such as images, VMs, network topology, shared folders, and, yes, also volumes. Smaug APIs enable DR tools to focus on the orchestration of the DRP, instead of integrating with the many possible backup and protection tools and solutions. In this session, we will give a short introduction to Smaug project and dive into the Service Continuity use case in more details.
