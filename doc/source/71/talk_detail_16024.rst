Real-time KVM as OpenStack NFV hypervisor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For network functions virtualization (NFV) workloads, telecommunications companies demand an extremely low-latency, real-time platform. Real-time makes sure there is a defined time limit for worst case latency. This is to process hard deadlines of workloads to avoid any disruption or failure. In this session, we will talk about: - Changes/configurations done in low level kernel-based virtual machine (KVM)/kernel level and how OpenStack is taking advantage of these changes. - Features we are using with real-time KVM like DPDK, vhost-user and OpenvSwitch to solve the latency and throughput needs of telecommunications companies. - Also, we will give a snapshot of performance numbers from our testing with OpenStack Platform and real-time KVM.

My interest lies in how changes in low level networking infrastructure with realtime kernel and KVM fulfil needs of telecom companies for NFV workloads. Also, how this infrastructure is leveraged by Open Stack. I used OpenStack to replicate the latency and throughput numbers which we get with real-time.)*
