Decomposing a monolithic architecture through common frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack provides a monolithic canvas to build the cloud of your dreams.  Building the "Art of the Possible" can disable even the best architect. Development of rapid, modular and fluid IT demands more from infrastructure through the application layer. Decomposing the architecture and align it with common frameworks built in small appliance-like blocks requires enterprise architectures need to be more flexible and liquid, forcing architects and engineers to think on designs that are more appliance driven. This session is designed to be a deep dive into containerization of the entire cloud infrastructure and application layer. We will look at the technical considerations, review tradeoffs and look at an example environment that has various levels of simplified blocks to enable snap-on like Lego Blocks.
