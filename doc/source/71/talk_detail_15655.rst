Ceilometer to Almanach: Scalability, accuracy and efficiency in measuring and billing resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Ceilometer is the "all you-can-eat buffet" of event notifications in OpenStack; so, it naturally comes with its own set of challenges. However, many businesses need the ability to pinpoint to a specific subset of those events and to retrieve them in an efficient and scalable manner. Enter Almanach, our solution to this very problem. In this presentation, its main contributors will explain how it leverages the specialized nature of both cloud and bare-metal event workloads to filter only those events who are relevant to a specific process (e.g. billing, platform health checks etc.)

Almanach is an event-based system used as a data source for OpenStack billing. He solved race conditions within a multiple cell deployment, despite the headaches. This coding monkey and caffeine junkie speaks Python fluently, and flawlessly supports the OpenStack deployment at Internap. During his spare time he can be found impressing the crowd at bouldering gyms, swing dance events or near any PokeStops. This attaching individual can be easily identified by his crocodile dundee hat.)*
