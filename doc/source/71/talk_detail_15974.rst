A Simple Way to Backup and Restore OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Backup and Restore is important for OpenStack users to keep their data safe. It is an essential function for most of the enterprises using OpenStack. But most users don’t know that backup and restore is easy to achieve in OpenStack. This session presents how to simply backup and restore the cloud and shows some experiences with a use case. OpenStack is friendly to backup and restore operations. Databases and configurations are two main parts to be backed up and restored. We have designed a simple way to backup and restore the controller plane of Openstack. Nova, Glance, Keystone, Horizon, Cinder, Neutron, Heat and Ceilometer are included in the scope. The method was implemented in IBM Cloud Manager, which is a cloud solution based on Openstack and released to clients.
