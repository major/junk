OpenStack Hardware Selection Panel: Ceph perf on Dell, QCT, Supermicro, Samsung, SanDisk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This panel of Dell, Supermicro, QCT, Samsung, and SanDisk architects will discuss performance results from recently published Ceph benchmark studies.  Contrast results from flash-sleds and flash arrays, to standard, dense, and ultra-dense HDD-based servers. Ceph is the most commonly-deployed storage with OpenStack.  OpenStack Ceph clusters can support a wide range of IO workloads.  But which hardware can provide desired performance optimized for target workload IO patterns?  Attend this panel for a lively discussion on this question as well as emerging hardware trends.
