Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm Mode for OpenStack Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The container and container orchestration are some of the most attracting technologies for software delivery, maintenance, and upgrade. The technologies can get rid of some pain points that operators hit in their operations (e.g. deploy, upgrade and failover) and make it simple to manage systems. OpenStack is also one of the software products, so cloud operators would like to get the benefit using containers to deploy OpenStack. However, there are several options for container technology and also for container orchestration technology. That makes the operators harder to choose which they should use. This talk presents a comparison between two major container orchestration technologies, Kubernetes and Docker Swarm Mode, for OpenStack deployment. This shows you Pros/Cons of both orchestrators for the deploying purpose, as well as what are new pain points of operations on containerized OpenStack.
