"Do I need a Cloud Management Platform to manage OpenStack? "
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We often find that day two operations in OpenStack can be very painful, and a Cloud Management Platform (CMP) can help with this. A CMP can easily manage monitoring, insights, security or compliance, as well as basic chargeback. During this session we will do a live demonstration to illustrate the benefits of a CMP.

In 2010 he changed his area to Cloud environments and he has been collaborating in the design and architecture on several Private and Public clouds working with a System Integrator, and got involved in different projects, one of them was OpenStack. Since then, he tried to integrate OpenStack with the existing technologies as well to understand how OpenStack fits in the current Customer's ecosystem as an Architect In 2014 he joined Canonical to expand the architecture of their products and add his expertise to the business, as well as complex architecture's integration experiences By the end of 2015 he left Canonical but he is still interested on OpenStack and following the community very closely)*
