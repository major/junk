Highly available OpenStack. Making sure OpenStack is always there to dispense cloudy goodness.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many components to OpenStack and many have different HA requirements and HA strategies. In this session we will look though which components need to be highly available and the choices you have around configuring those services. The journey will take us from database replication, to instance migration and stopping off at API endpoint HA with VIPs and DNS records on the way.
