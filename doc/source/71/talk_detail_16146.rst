Identity Management at Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the Openstack community continues to innovate its architecture at a large enterprise scale, Keystone as an Identity Manager is lagging behind.  Multi-cloud and multi-region architectures often have a need for synchronizing both full or partial identities and assignments across sites. This session aims to highlight various identity architectures based on the typical integration requirements of an enterprise environment. Such architectures include integrating with Active Directory, integrating with an Identity Provider, and synchronizing multi-site Keystone identities. Keystone also suffers from the lack of auditing and reporting capabilities, a requirement highly important at large scale. The second portion of this talk aims to introduce Midpoint (OSS covered under the apache 2.0 open source license) as an alternative identity manager behind the scenes, and showcase how a comprehensive identity management solution can address the challenges that Keystone currently fails to address.

I've architected, deployed and managed a cloud for one of the top hospitals in Toronto, Canada after which I took more architectural orientated role with Mirantis. I'm currently working towards a more formal solution for Identity Managment and RBAC within Openstack. )*

After some time I  also started with deployments for customers connected with midPoint and single sign-on solutions. Currently I work mostly on designing and implementing midPoint.)*
