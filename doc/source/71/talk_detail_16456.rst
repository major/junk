Adventures with Kolla
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

I've been using container technologies for 10 years so i'm always looking for ways to encapsulate applications, services or VPS, Kolla caught my eye because it provides production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating OpenStack clouds that are scalable, fast, reliable, and upgradable using community best practices. This talk is about the experience i had using Kolla in my personal server infrastructure, okay, okay, in the headless desktop systems i have inside my closet which i use to test and deploy OpenStack development and other stuff.
