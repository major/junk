Deploying and optimizing for cloud storage systems using Swift simulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the rise of cloud systems, IT spending on the storage system is increasing. In order to minimize costs, architects must optimize system capacities and characteristics. Current capacity planning is mostly based on trial and errors as well as rough resource estimations. With increasing hardware diversity and software stack complexity this approach is not efficient enough. This session presents a novel simulation approach, which can be used before system provisioning for cluster capacity planning, performance evaluation, and optimization. Questions such as how to size the cluster, how to configure the software parameters and how to choose the best hardware components can be answered even before software and hardware components are made available.
