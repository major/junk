Intelligent Model-driven Cloud Infrastructre Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Our presentation is about infrastructure modeling and how it affects continuous operations of Openstack deployments. We will explain how to use models to govern all aspects of day-to-day operations. How to continuously deliver new features and bugfixes into production environment. Setup the ongoing monitoring of log messages and metrics coming from resources that gives operators overview of the current infrastructure health. We will show you how modern orchestrators like openstack-salt, Fuel or Cloudify solve the issues of continuously maintaining the service level of OpenStack deployment within given SLAs and how the service model definitions differ. At the end the service model ontology will give you the ability to track and solve any critical situation and define automated response or learning mechanism to react to events. The presentation will be accompanied by a live demonstration.
