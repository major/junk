Global name space of data between OpenStack, on premise and public cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hybrid cloud environments are real now. Enterprises are no longer sticking to a single cloud, they are opting for a hybrid approach of having a OpenStack private cloud and one or more public clouds. In this session we will showcase the scalable Veritas NAS solution that can manage data present in OpenStack, on premise and other public clouds using a single global namespace.  A single global namespace of OpenStack and on premise data greatly reduces complexities of data management and migration.
