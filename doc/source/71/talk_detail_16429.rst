Control Plane Architectures: Design Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building an OpenStack private cloud can be very complex.  Underpinning the entire operational capabilities of your cloud is the Control Plane.  It's common knowledge you should treat your cloud resources "like cattle" and not "pets", yet most clouds treat the control plane like a favored pet. How should the modern cloud architect choose to design the control plane aspect of your private cloud?
