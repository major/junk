~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In setting up OpenStack in Production, there are a number of services like RabbitMQ and Databases that are shared between each of the OpenStack services. Each of these services need to adhere to tuning and optimizations so that each OpenStack service that rely on them can be performant in a Production environment.
