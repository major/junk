Embracing Openstack, the right way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is usually one of the first steps of a company’s IT transformation. This transformation forces the IT departments to move out of their comfort zone and embrace new concepts, new processes, and new technologies. That’s why users don’t simply deploy OpenStack in production and hope that everything will be ok. Using our field experience, Red Hat has developed a consulting model to cover the gaps so we don’t limit ourselves to putting an OpenStack platform in the customer’s premises. Instead, we make sure that the customer can achieve their goal of moving to cloud technologies using OpenStack. In this session we will share our consulting model, along with real examples of bad habits that could make an OpenStack project fail.
