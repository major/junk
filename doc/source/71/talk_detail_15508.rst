Rolling Upgrades - Performance between OpenStack Deployed in VMs and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation compares and evaluates the numerical rolling upgrades performance between OpenStack deployed in VMs and containers. Many operators are considering moving from VM-deployed OpenStack to container-deployed OpenStack partially because of better rolling upgrade performance provided by containers. However, no numerical test results are ever presented to show this performance improvements gained by containers during rolling upgrades. Thus, we want cover it in this presentation.
