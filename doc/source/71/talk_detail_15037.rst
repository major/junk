On Building an Auto-healing Resource Cluster using Senlin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building auto-healing cluster is always not an easy job in cloud environment. How to accurately detect failures happen in different layers; how to promptly make fencing to prevent further damage; how to make recovery progress automatically and efficiently, all these headaches need to be addressed before we can announce our systems/applications as auto-healing. In this presentation, we will deep dive into Senlin's health management design to introduce how we address all these issues and fill in the gap.
