Building secure-networks across cloud boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You want agility, flexibility, and security for your cloud. That means utilizing all the cloud environments in your disposal to run applications, designing your IT at ANY SCALE while securing your network end-to-end.      With this secure elastic cloud, your workloads move between private and public clouds dynamically while utilizing the best compute vehicle available to run a particular workload, requiring Cloud Connect technology to connect any compute environments anywhere.    Not to mention you must isolate tenants running on your shared IT infrastructure and protect workloads across cloud boundaries.     Juniper has the answer.  With this demo, we will showcase: 1: Secure: Tenant isolation & protect workloads 2: Hybrid Cloud: Build your IT as service at any scale   3: Freedom of Choice: Run applications on different compute environments.
