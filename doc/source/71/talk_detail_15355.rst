Building a Production Grade Cloud from Scratch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Do you have a bunch of hardware laying around and want to transform that into a cloud?  Not just a prototype cloud, but one where you can deliver a reliable SLA, high quality components, and top tier performance?This session will outline our experiences building production grade clouds using just the open-source projects within the OpenStack ecosystem.  We'll share our challenges and successes of building these high grade, heterogenous clouds.  We will also distribute our cloud reference architecture built using the OpenPOWER which documents this repeatable pattern for setting up cloud infrastructures.
