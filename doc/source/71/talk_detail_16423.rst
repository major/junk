OpenContrail, Openstack and building a hardware and SDN integrated CICD Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Operators at telco scale have large OpenStack setups beyond the typical neutron L3 gateway case. They typically have to integrate with more than one SDN vendor that will be different from who their physical networking infrastructure comes from. We faced challenges building, maintaining, and operating clouds at this scale and rolling out complex and new software releases. In this talk we explore the strategies large telco’s like AT&T employ and use when building their CI/testing chains and beyond how they plan to use off the shelf open source tools when testing them and how OpenStack helps make that easier.

* **Buddy Yaussy** *(As a Principal Member of Technical Staff at AT&T (AT&T Foundry), Buddy is focused on the company's publicly stated goal of moving their networks towards a software-defined, virtualized infrastructure. How can AT&T migrate their highly specialized "monster" wired and wireless networks? Relying on his background in networking, high-speed communications and multimedia content creation, management and delivery, Buddy is actively in the process of figuring it out! Buddy graduated from West Point, USMA, and has spent a long career developing various communications devices and technologies with Hayes, Broadcom, Scientific Atlanta and AT&T. Buddy is currently a member of the AT&T Foundry, where he and his team are focused on NFV-ifying various mobility and wireline consumer services, re-engineering and deploying new and legacy applications to our Openstack/Contrail integrated cloud, and evolving the U-verse/DirecTV media platforms for 2020 and beyond.)*
