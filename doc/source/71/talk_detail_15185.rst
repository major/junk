Globally Dispersed Active-Active Cloud Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

So the concept and capability of running multiple OpenStack cloud regions is not a new one.  With that said have you actually seen it done?  Is there way to centrally manage all those cloud regions?  How can this strategy be used to replace a disaster recovery design?  What are the components you need to accomplish this design model and have it scale if needed? During this talk we will walk thru a few use cases of setting up an Active-Active cloud region and then physically demonstrate how to accomplish this design in a short demo.  Audience takaways: Review the native capabilities part of OpenStack to run multiple cloud regions Detail out the components needed to architectually setup this design Explore how simple it is to centrally manage those regions Discuss some known areas of caution and how to circumvent them Talk thru how to scale the active-active region design when needed
