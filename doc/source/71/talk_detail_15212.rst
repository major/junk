Have a bite of 1K+ nodes with a handful of servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One big reason of the challenges brought by deploying OpenStack at large scale (beyond 1K nodes) is that the code is not developed and tested on a deployment at such large scale.  Intel together with SVMSoft China (a joint venture of Sugon and VMware in China) have been seeking a way to provision a large scale cloud with fairly little hardware mainly for product quality assurance purpose. What has been achieved is an agile, lightweight, scalable system which provisions cloud at large scale in containers. This system has been used for ensuring that our products scale well and provides good performance at large scale. This presentation will reveal data in aspects such as container intensity, footprint, optimization and networking. It also has a performance comparison between vanilla neutron and neutron with OpenDaylight as the backend. This system can be used as a CI (Contiguous Integration) system for community.
