OpenStack Enablement on AArch64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As ARM advances in server field and hardware is widely available, software ismore important than ever for success. To ensure adoption, all workloads must beprofiled and improved for ARM servers.OpenStack as the state of art cloud solution is, in our view, essential for thedata center. The Linaro SDI team is focusing on OpenStack enablement, profilingand upstreaming patches for AArch64, trying to make OpenStack as architectureindependent as possible. This presentation is about the current status and planfor making the OpenStack experience on AArch64 awesome, with emphasis on thechanges required for computing, networking and storage. We will also describein detail the ARM server development environment and related upstream patches.Please, let us know if you want to help!


* **Yibo Cai** *(I joined ARM workload team at March-2016. My major job is to enable and profile OpenStack on AArch64. Though new to OpenStack, I'm finding it's an interesting and challenging field. My first task is to enable Ironic on AArch64. Now I'm working on Neutron and OpenDaylight. Before join ARM, I worked in four companies of Telecom, consumer electronics, industrial instrumentation and automotive electronics fields.)*
