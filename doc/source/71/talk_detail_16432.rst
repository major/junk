Openstack Flavor series, an AWS Parity for Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack defines Flavors which is synonymous to instance Types in AWS, but what the opensource community lacks is clear categorization of flavors depicting various Tenant offerings and capabilities, something AWS and other public cloud providers have an edge. This session aims to introduce the concept of “flavor series” to draw the parity of flavor categorization in Openstack cloud. We will share process, flows and design on how to go about defining flavors series and creating, distributing and managing flavors and host aggregates over multiple independent cloud zones. You will learn how we leveraged HEAT Templates as a standard resource definition interface to perform our complete platform resource life cycle management. We will show recorded demo on how to use Openstack Resource Manager Framework we introduced at Austin Summit to accomplish this distribution.
