Dockerizing the Hard Services: Neutron & Nova
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We'll talk about the benefits and pitfalls involved in successfully running complex services like Neutron and Nova inside of Docker containers. Topics will include: What magic incantations are needed to run these services at all? How to prevent HA router failover on service restarts. How to prevent network namespaces from breaking everything. Lessons learned in how to manage configuration changes and deployments. Bonus: If time allows, we'll also discuss what is needed in order to run Cinder in Docker containers.
