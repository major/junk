Building Data Centers of the Future with OpenStack and Composable Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The datacenters of the future will leverage disaggregated hardware with software that enables dynamic programmatic composition, control, and management. The cloud infrastructure can expand and shrink to meet transient demands from workloads, in addition to the hosts themselves being repurposed to closely match the workload requirements. Intel Rack Scale Design (RSD) takes us closer to that vision, implementing the DMTF Redfish API and extending upon it. The Plasma project in OpenStack has been created to integrate Rack Scale Design with Nova and Ironic to dynamically add and release resources as necessary to meet workload demands. Lenovo is developing new hardware management capabilities and pluggable interfaces to support RSD and Plasma. We will present the architecture of RSD and the design of Lenovo’s systems management software layer and APIs for OpenStack RSD plug-ins.
