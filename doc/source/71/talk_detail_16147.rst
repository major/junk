Swift and Hummingbird: As seen in the wild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Hummingbird is the golang reimplementation of the OpenStack Swift object layer that is currently being reviewed by the upstream Swift community.  At Rackspace, we have deployed Hummingbird to our largest clusters. In this presentation we will go over how we deployed hummingbird and share the performance gains we made.  But beyond the customer API we have done a major redesign to the object replication engine. While not as obvious or apparent as the gains in the API this is a major improvement in cluster health and efficiency.
