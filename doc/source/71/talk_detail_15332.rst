What not to do with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It has been 6 years since the first OpenStack release and it is now widely known what use cases it fits and what potential it brings to your organization. Less known and talked about is what not to do with it.  Considering the complexity that OpenStack has gained, sometimes it’s not clear if adopting it in your own workflow is the best call. In fact, it’s not as simple as determining if OpenStack can work or not for you, but you also have to consider how you should deploy OpenStack to fulfill your needs. We will leverage real world use cases to explain when the effort required to migrate to OpenStack is worth it and when it is best to stick with a more traditional architecture. More often than not critical points may not be visible at first and, since these are the ones that define success or failure in a deployment, we will give a few tips on how to recognize them in the future.

Whenever I've been hacking too much at the OS level, I yearn to code a bit, and viceversa. My OS of choice is Gentoo Linux, and my programming language is, of course, Python. I am always looking for ways to use the latter to ease my daily work with the former. From time to time, I also teach Red Hat OpenStack courses.)*
