OpenStack: Shifting from Hardware to Software Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Gartner analyzed data centers for a period of 10 years and found that 47% of all problems were caused by cloud services outages, with a duration ranging between 40 minutes and five days. Ponemon Institute found that on average outages cost US$ 690.204.The increasing use of commodity hardware to build data centers will negatively contribute to the reliability of existing cloud computing platforms.Thus, the development of new techniques and methods to evaluate and increase the reliability of cloud platforms from a software perspective is fundamental.The first part of this presentation will present the mechanisms that pioneers, such as Amazon, Google, and Netflix, have already developed to increase the reliability of their cloud platforms.The second part of the presentation will describe how T-Systems and Huawei are exploring the use of fault-injection mechanisms to effectively increase the reliability of the Open Telekom Cloud platform from Deutsche Telekom, an OpenStack-based platform.

A core of this work consists in proposing key technical solutions (e.g., IT Operations Analytics, Cloud/Client Computing, Business Process as a Service, Cloud Migration Tools, IT Operations Analytics, Heuristic Automation, and IT Service Orchestration) for the effective and advanced management of the Deutsche Telekom Public Cloud in Germany and the Huawei Enterprise Cloud in China.)*

* **Kurt Garloff** *(I grew up in Germany where I graduated in Physics at University of Dortmund. I moved to Eindhoven (The Netherlands) to do postgrad research on plasma physics.I had developed an interest in computers and in particular in the Open Source and Linux movements in parallel and had contributed some code successfully to the Linux kernel when the community was still small. I also succeeded contributing little pieces to a number of other projects (amongst which glibc and gcc).In the end the computer side won over physics and I ended up working for SUSE Linux AG (later part of Novell Inc) as a freelancer and quickly as employee.  I worked as kernel engineer but also took some responsibility in security projects. I ended up running SUSE Labs, the research department hosting the prominent open source kernel, toolchain (compiler ...) and X11 engineers that we managed to hire.Subsequently, I had a number of technical, people and business leadership roles (Head Architect, acting VP Engineering, VP Product Management, VP Business Development, VP Partner Engineering) and I'm grateful to Novell for sending me to the HBS Program for Leadship Development to enhance my business skills before taking over business management functions.The acquisition of Novell by Attachmate ended my career with SUSE and the next step was being part of the BU Cloud Services in Deutsche Telekom's P&I which was had a lot of the startup spirit I was looking for.. In my VP Cloud Technology function I headed the unit that developed the Consumer Cloud Storage platform (DLS/Mediencenter) and the OpenStack based hosting infrastructure for hosting the software partners apps in DT's TelekomCloud BusinessMarketplace. The Telekom project has been cmpleted and I currently work as freelancer, helping IT companies to build technology and business strategy strategy and to build great engineering capabilities.I last supported Huawei's European IT R&D department to be successful with OpenStack.When I don't work on computers, I spend my time with my great wife and two wonderful kids.)*
