Baremetal to Openstack on Kubernetes from 0 to 100
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Imagine you have 13 data centers. Each with a rack of completely blank servers. You have a small but strong, cross-functional team. Your misson, if you choose to accept it, is to deploy and operate an Openstack installation in each data center. What would you do? We chose to drink the kool aid and use Kubernetes and Kolla to manage the Openstack deployments. CoreOS as the underlying operating system promises to minimise operational burden. Bootstrapping this setup in an automated fashion revealed a unique set of challenges that we would like to share. This talk showcases SAP's approach to combine Kolla, Kubernetes and CoreOS into a control plane for an Openstack based private cloud. We will explore how to automatically bootstrap a multi-regional, containerised Openstack from bare metal. A demonstration of our continuous delivery workflow and tools will give you deep hands-on insight. In closing we will discuss pain points and problems we encountered in using a containerised Openstack.
