‘Hyperconwhat?!’ - Hyper-Converged OpenStack and Ceph Demystified
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Efficiency in IT has never really been just a nice-to-have. But as increasingly sophisticated compute and data storage needs to be spread further throughout your business's operational landscape, efficiency in gear acquisition, system deployment, ops, and IT resource management becomes a decidedly firm requirement for success. Popular use cases come from the Telecommunications sector, particularly for NFV workloads-operators looking for single-rack deployments of OpenStack generally will want to consider hyper-converged configurations In this session, you will learn how hyperconverged infrastructures can help you make your business and your platform more efficient by simplifying operations. We will dive into hyperconverged basics, analyse the challenges that come with OpenStack in this model, and finally give you the complete recipe for a perfect start with hyperconverged compute and storage in OpenStack.
