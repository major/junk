The final word on Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Availability zones are one of the most frequently misunderstood and misused constructs in OpenStack. And why not? Each OpenStack service implements them differently -- if it even implements them at all. And yet they are also one of the most important, providing a robust HA option for tenant applications.This session will definitively answer, once and for all, questions such as what availability zones are (and are not), which OpenStack services support AZs and how they relate to one another, the limitations of AZs and best practices and industry standards for using availability zones, including gotchas and lessons learned.
