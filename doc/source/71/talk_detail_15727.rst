When not to share - a Global Cloud Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we take a fundamental approach (with diagrams/pictures) to designing a Global Cloud for a customer. We discuss how to use a ‘shared-nothing’ approach, coupled with an orchestration layer that ties it all together. We discuss the reasons why this approach is best and why this discussion should happen before anything else in the move to Cloud. Our intent is to allow listeners to learn from our mistakes and successes, and start the Cloud journey out on the right foot. This is a 101-level talk, geared toward the IT business decicion makers (CxO, VP, Director, Manager), who need to the best way to approach Cloud before they spend resources on the effort.
