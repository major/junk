Liberate your CloudFoundry installation from being constrained to a single cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud Infrastructure components are here to fail, while your service – in our case your cloud foundry installation – is here to stay available and keeps the hosted applications running. How do you stay available, while whole clouds are going down, either for maintenance or due to failure? At Swisscom we think that cloud infrastructure should be kept as simple as possible, meaning that it is here to deliver a platform that enables rapid delivery and deployment of cloud-native workload. Such a simplicity means that we keep a single stack to a single region and a single availability zone and for example do not stretch shared storage over two sites. However, what matters is that in the end users would still like to access their service running on top of Cloud Foundry and also the platform to deploy new applications should stay alive.
