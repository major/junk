OpenStack: you can take it to the bank!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Being the largest bank in Central and Eastern Europe and the only Russian bank featuring in the World's Top 50 Biggest Banks, Sberbank operates a diverse set of business critical applications hosted on heterogeneous x86 / RISC infrastructure and needs to update them much faster than ever to keep ahead of the game. On its journey towards becoming a true Agile Enterprise, Sberbank has chosen OpenStack and Murano to speed up provisioning of complex multi-tier applications spread across KVM, VMware vSphere, MS Hyper-V, IBM PowerVM and Oracle SPARC virtual machines as well asÂ bare-metal servers for 6500+ in-house developers and QA engineers. This session will provide some details on architectural decisions, trade-offs and lessons learned while designing and building such a complex OpenStack environment.
