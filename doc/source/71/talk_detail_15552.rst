Will it Blend? The Joint OpenStack Kubernetes Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Will they blend? There's only one way to find out! Join experience DevOps mix-master, Rob Hirschfeld, in this fun and informative exploration. Since the OpenStack on Kubernetes keynote in Austin, there are been many discussions about if and how to deliver a Joint OpenStack Kubernetes Environment. Specifically, using Kubernetes as an underlay. In this presentation, we'll explore the potential benefits and downsides of this configuration. Then, assuming it's a good idea, we'll give into the real architectural and operational work needed to implement a robust OpenStack cloud using Kubernetes. We'll discuss the pros and cons of including the Nova compute nodes in K8s management. Finally, we'll outline upstream work that's needed to turn OpenStack into a cloud native application.


* **Rob Hirschfeld** *(Rob Hirschfeld has been involved in OpenStack since the earliest days with a focus on ops and building the infrastructure that powers cloud and storage.Â  He's also co-Chair of the Kubernetes Cluster Ops SIG and a four term OpenStack board member. The RackN team has deep knowledge of Kubernetes (we've been deploying it on clouds and metal), OpenStack (we created the Crowbar project) and cloud native architecture (we migrated Digital Rebar to be micro-services). Basically, Rob has deep ops knowledge of both platforms AND experience with cloud native migrations. He's also a regular speaker at OpenStack Summits about items including SDN, interop and running Kubernetes.
