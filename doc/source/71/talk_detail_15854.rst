Improving Postgresql Concurrency with VCPU Overcommit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nowadays web-based Information System (WBIS) is commonly used in Indonesian Universities. The most important component for WBIS is Database. Relational database systems such as PostgreSQL is widely used by University with large student body, where high concurrency is likely to happen when all student access the information system at the same time. Comparison between bare metal server versus virtual machine performance will be presented, further discussion will focus on the improvement of Postgresql concurrency access Â which have been achieved by overcommitting CPU within Openstack deployment at The University of Jember (UNEJ) Private Datacenter.

I spent my early primary, secondary dan under graduate education in Indonesia, then I went to Sydney and Newcastle Australia to do my PhD in the area of Computational Chemistry. In 2003 I spent 6 months in Heidelberg Germany for short research on Molecular Dynamics. I spent most of my time now working as a chemistry lecturer at University of Jember, I am also IT manager at my University where I implement Openstack for managing my University computing resources.)*
