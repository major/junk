The Key Components of Adopting CI The OpenStack Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack’s Continuous Integration (CI) structure is an invaluable tool for stabilizing builds and code repositories. Yet, some may feel that this implementation of CI is too cumbersome to adopt. This session will prove how easy it can be to adopt, configure and migrate existing projects. We will also discuss how a software team can benefit from a CI infrastructure that fits with the OpenStack way, how to stabilize it and which tools we use to do so: Ansible, Jenkins Job Builder, and our internally-developed tool, PrivateStack.
