Controlling access to OpenStack in the Enterprise, this is not a public cloud!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Addressing access control in the enterprise is a hugh challange, as a cloud architect and cloud operator we need to take into account the complexities of exisiting enterprise authentication standards and requirements. The maturity of Openstack authentication mechanisms allows for limited controls and auditing that often dont meet the percieved needs of the enterprise.  We will discussion the short falls and challenges that exisit in Openstack today and what is being done to through blueprints and proposed patches to remedy the situation  Finally we will present a possible solution to the problem, and include a demo of a working RBAC solution for the enterprise.
