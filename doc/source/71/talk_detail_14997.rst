OpenStack For VMware Technologists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Is OpenStack just a free alternative to VMware technologies or are there substantive differences? Is there a way to integrate VMware technologies like vSphere with OpenStack? As OpenStack continues to gain momentum and grow in user adoptoon, VMware admins and architects are being asked to evaluate, deploy and manage new OpenStack clouds. This presentation will walk through the OpenStack architecture and it's various components and explain them to VMware technologists using concepts familiar to them. We will walk through what uses cases are best for OpenStack and what use cases are best on VMware infrastructure. We will also drill down on how OpenStack is able to integrate with vSphere using the vCenter nova driver, neutron, and cinder. Although we will be briefly evaluate various OpenStack offerings that integrate with vSphere, this will NOT be a product pitch or product presentation. All technical detail presented will be based on the upstream code. Â
