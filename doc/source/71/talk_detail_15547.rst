A Telco's perspective: interconnect multi-DC Clouds using OpenStack and SDN Über-controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation describes a Telecommunication Service Provider solution approach for Multi-Data Center and Multi-Region-OpenStack setup by using the concept of an SDN Uber-controller. Telco cloud is characterized by a number of distributed Data Centers operated as independent OpenStack installations. Aspects of distributed workloads and high availability, management of distributed networking Neutron resources, multi-DC service and multi-DC service chaining will be explained. Also, Multi-Region setup in the context of multi-region keystone support and the possible mechanism like MySQL replication or LDAP over multiple Data Centers will be described.  The Presentation includes a real live demo where a concept of SDN Uber-controller will be shown. Monitoring of distributed Neutron networking resources via the SDN-Uber-controller will be demonstrated.
