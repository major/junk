Vanilla or distributions: How do they differentiate?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

If it comes to OpenStack there is always the question: vanilla or a distribution. You have the agony of choice, it will highly depend on your usecase and organization. This presentation will not only highlight differences and similarities between these choices but also between the major OpenStack distributions. We will take a look behind the curtain of the OpenStack products. What should you know about the offerings? Is there anything you may should evaluate before you choose a solution? There is more to take a look at than only the OpenStack product itself if you include also e.g. KVM and Ceph. What about the base distributions and support? This talk will cover besides Vanilla also RedHat, SUSE, Ubuntu/Canonical, and Mirantis OpenStack.
