Innovation BBVA: Next generation Overlay for Kubernetes and Openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

During this session, BBVA’s innovation department will give an update on how it is transforming its OpenStack infrastructure to become fully containerized. They selected Kubernetes as a platform for dynamic lifecycle management, to quickly stop/start openstack services and place them where desired.  From a networking perspective they are leveraging the overlay technology of Nuage Networks, that has intimately worked with them to  model both OpenStack’s infrastructure networks as the VM networks as overlay networks into a homogenous networking space.

I'm developing cloud services in order to apply new technologies to the traditional Bank services. Currently, I'm involved in the deployment of a public cloud based on Openstack and SDN in the BBVA bank for continious delivery purposes. The most important key in the project is the automation of everything)*
