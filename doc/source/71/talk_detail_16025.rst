Containerization and Micro-Services: Technology in Transition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Containerization is gaining much attention in the OpenStack environment.  This presentation explores how and where containers are being used, the merits of containerization, and in particular technology trends and how the IT industry is responding to them.  Those who can see big-picture shifts and changes and the forces that are shaping them are in the best position to capture the greatest befits from the winds of change.  This presentation will most help software engineers to understand key steps in the transition from legacy systems to those that will faciliate cloud-based deployment with containerized services.
