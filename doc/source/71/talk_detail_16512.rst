The Elephant in the Database: Keystone’s schema can’t scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The current Keystone database schema may suffice for 50 users across 10 projects, but it will break for any significantly large scale deployment. In this session, we will discuss the problems with the current schema, and offer a potential roadmap that would permanently solve these issues. * See what happens when we try to utilize 10,000 users, 1,000 projects, and 10 roles. * Hear what occurred in our production environment when table indices could no longer fit in memory. * Experience the significant scalability improvements Keystone could have with a simple schema change that can be implemented with little effort.
