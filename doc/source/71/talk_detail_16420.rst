Orchestrate, Secure, Recover SRIOV Virtual Network Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

You might have heard about SRIOV and its benefits to Customers requesting high speed and bandwidth to support the Virtual Network Function Needs, but still you might be missing an end to end picture on how to orchestrate, enforce security and how to recover a failed SRIOV VM. At AT&T we designed and made it simple for our VNF customers to create SRIOV networks via HEAT and Neutron and extension to NOVA Compute. And to better things, we have imposed security rules by using DPDK APIs to configure the Virtual functions and at the same time our design didn’t deviate much from Openstack APIs and governance. This will be a great opportunity for anyone looking to learn about how SRIOV and DPDK APIs work in tandem to provide fast data path networks for Virtual Network Functions in your private cloud and enterprise needs.
