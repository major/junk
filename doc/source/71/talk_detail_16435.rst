Building the Perfect OpenStack Appliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Selecting a hardware platform to create a hardened OpenStack appliance is a daunting task.  In this presentation, we'll cover real world examples of hardware configurations designed to help you accelerate your initiative to build an appliance (or appliance-like) device for your OpenStack initiative.  We will cover: base hardware platform format the nuts and bolts of the hardware the hardware parts and their drivers as they relate to Linux considerations for OpenStack networking  hardware lifecycle management going to market - customization of the platform Real world hardware configurations and examples will be provided of various platform configurations.
