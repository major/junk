Designing  scalable and resilient  OpenStack deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Scalable OpenStack cloud deployment isn’t trivial and the unpredictable nature of public cloud workloads adds an extra layer of uncertainty. Enterprise OpenStack cloud deployments are expected to have qualities like high availability, scalability, performance gurantees and security inherent in their architecture.  If you are planning on deploying an OpenStack public cloud, how exactly can you architect your OpenStack components on the underlying infrastructure while maintaining zero down-time, performance guarantees, and tenant isolation at the same time? In this session, we take a peek into some of the specific requirements for OpenStack cloud architecture from our customers leading to some of the architecture design choices. We also discuss how converged infrastructure architecture can meet the above challenges.
