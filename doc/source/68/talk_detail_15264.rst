Patching 100 OpenStack compute nodes with zero-day patch within 16 hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Undisclosed vulnerabilities are very serious threats to the cloud security. Once the flaw leaks to the public information, the risk of attacks increases dramatically. Because of that, it is crucial to apply zero-day patches in cloud environment as fast as possible and transparently to the end user. In our talk we will go through case study of applying zero-day patch on 100 OpenStack compute nodes running 4000 virtual machines within 16 hours. We will talk about the challenges we have encountered and how we dealt with them. Additionally, we will present how patching process using live migration affected the workload running inside of the virtual machines. At the end we will answer the most important question – did we make it within 16 hours.
