One control plane to rule them all:­ Managing physical and  virtual infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Real production experience using Ironic is scarce­­ and it's even more scarce when combined with Nova for VMs. The general problem is the need to provide a single API layer and portal for managing bare­metal servers and virtual machines in a data center to make end­users' lives easier and even moreso in the multi­datacenter use­case when you either need to have single control plane to manage them all or share permissions across multiple OpenStack deployments. Additionally, users need to provision servers for their apps with an easy-­to­use virtualization layer. We will share our experience at Symantec in using Ironic and Nova in a single OpenStack deployment to enable both cases.
