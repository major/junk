Start small think big - a journey from manual VPS to the cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We share our OpenStack journey: from a manual VPS provisioning to a growing self-service OpenStack cloud. We will focus on how we were able to start small but design for scale. We will cover the whole lifecycle of the service from design to deployment to operations. We'll share our lessons learned and give you some tips on how to get started with your own OpenStack cloud.
