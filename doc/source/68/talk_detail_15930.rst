Top Considerations for Operating Database as a Service in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Databases are a key component in the vast majority of workloads that are a great fit for OpenStack. Using Trove to easily dispense database instances in an as-a-service model is an attractive option for those deploying OpenStack. In this talk, we will open the “trove” of wisdom to discuss different facets of how to ensure successful deployment and ongoing operations of a Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offering within an OpenStack deployment.Attendees will gain insight into: Ideal use cases best addressed by leveraging DBaaS capabilities Important architectural considerations when designing the infrastructure for DBaaS Operational best practices in maintaining production DBaaS deployments Attendees should leave with improved knowledge around how to deploy and maintain production-grade DBaaS, as well as information about upcoming features in Trove that aim to improve the operator’s experience.
