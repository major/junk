Tales from the field: Openstack problems and solutions from user's point of view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this presentation, we will demonstrate real world OpenStack problems that are faced by our users. These problems result from high load, hardware capability and massive scale outs. We will focus mainly on problems encountered in Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Glance, MySQL Galera and RabbitMQ. We will also go over the solutions and workarounds that we have implemented in customers' environments and proven to work. Moreover, we will offer a concentrated knowledge base resulting from a few months of actual escalation experience.   This session will help attendees address their openstack issues quickly and efficiently thus reducing frustration and troubleshooting time. The solutions proposed are based on real scenarios that we had seen at various customers’ sites and proven to work.
