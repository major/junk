How OpenStack Cloud helped Transform iLayers Service provision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

iLayer has been providing Cloud Services to it's clients in Europe for many years. Being firmly committed to Open Source solutions this infastructure was initially built using IBM Hardware and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server capabilities, such as KVM. One massive limitation of the environment that we built was the Self Service aspect of cloud that has become a key capability for service provision, also the administration burden on iLayer to manage the environment reduced the productivity of our delivery model. With the advent of OpenStack we have been able to move from this highly intensive, mangement heavy environment offering limited customer autonomy to a much more poweful Infrastructure as a Service allowing us and our customers to gain. Join us and discuss how our journey to an OpenStack Cloud helped.
