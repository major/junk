DevOops: Lessons Learned From a Cloud Network Architect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

No one said networking was easy. Toss in Neutron with its dozens of configuration options, features and sometimes questionable documentation, and you're bound to have a hard time. Join us as we discuss some of the 'gotchas' that one will encounter when architecting and operating OpenStack clouds at both small and large scale. Participants will learn which OpenStack cloud networking technologies offer the most promise and which ones to avoid in the short and long term.
