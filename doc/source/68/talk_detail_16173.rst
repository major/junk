OpenStack Storage Panel Featuring Customers and Field Architects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Please join us for a panel discussion featuring customers and field architects. The theme of the discussion will be the use of all kinds of storage in OpenStack - block (Cinder), file (Manila), and object (Swift). Some of the questions our panel will guide you through will include: What types of storage are these and other customers using? What workloads are benefitting from OpenStack storage? What were some storage design challenges encountered? What were some takeaways upon overcoming these challenges? What are some DO's and DON’T's for OpenStack storage? What are the cost savings and efficiency gains using OpenStack Cinder, Manila, and Swift? How have customers planned for disasters and backups? What public clouds are customers using?
