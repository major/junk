BrokenStack: OpenStack Failure Stories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We have all heard the stories of overcoming the trials and tribulations of OpenStack and emerging into the glistening dawn of a new Cloud day.  But what about the ones who didn’t make it? What about the ones who awakened not in the bliss of Cloud Nirvana, but in the depths of Cloud Hell? What went wrong? What can we learn from these failures? How can we ensure that we do not suffer the same fate? For answers to these questions and more, attend “BrokenStack: OpenStack Failure Stories.”
