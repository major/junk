If I could go back: lessons learned after 4 years of OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Constant Contact began building its private cloud with the OpenStack "Folsom" release in early 2013. Today, the majority of Constant Contact's web services are now hosted on OpenStack. Nearly 4 years and 7 releases later, our small team of operators has accrued a long and colorful list of practices, stories, and regrets. This talk is directed atÂ our past selves, still in theÂ planning process, and looks back at what we got wrong, what we got right, andÂ applies lessons learned to our future plans. To support a continuously growing cloud with a small team, we've been pragmatic about which services to provide, done extensive work to integrate OpenStack with our existing infrastructure, and designed a deployment that exaggerates our team's strengths. The resulting cloud may not be conventional, but it meets our needs and is low maintenance.
