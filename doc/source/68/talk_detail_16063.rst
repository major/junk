~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Manual deployment in order to solve problem after large-scale automation.For example, adjust the network architecture，adjust the storage architecture, to do something with the third party solution, solve the problem of the network, the storage, the bill and so on. All kinds of large-scale deployment scenarios，it is not easy for large-scale deployment automation.It requires the solution and keep away from the pit.
