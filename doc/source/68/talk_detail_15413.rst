Troubleshooting Neutron: Physical and Virtual Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron has become much more mature in recent cycles, but challenges remain. Having an effective troubleshooting game plan is key. In this session, we will look at how to solve common Neutron issues such as: connectivity issues among instances connecting to instances on the associated floating IP SSH working only part of the time application struggling to transfer large payloads even though it has network connectivity
