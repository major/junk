800 hosts, a solid sandbox to run crash tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Huge infrastructure leads to huge problems! With public cloud, you need to manage thousands of bare metal servers, the problems you will encounter then are totally different from those with a rather small infrastructure. The best way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. With such matters you cannot learn by playing with toy models, we thus had no other choice but to run a real scaled infrastructure, call our crazy monkeys to crash the system and unplug different components, both hardware and software. During this journey, come with us to learn what we discovered, what we fixed and how we improved our recovery time to prevent new crashes. There was born our Crash Test infrastructure with more than 800 physical hosts.
