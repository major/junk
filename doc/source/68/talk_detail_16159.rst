OpenStack journey and challenges of the BBVA storage team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building a small OpenStack PoC Environment can be challenging for traditional IT teams but when you have to do a real production deployment to support your platform and development teams, new unexpected challenges come your way.  BBVA is the second largest bank in Spain and like many other big organizations BBVA is also on a journey to transform its IT. But, being a Bank BBVA has it's special hurdles as the stakes are way high. Today that BBVA is close to production readiness, we in this session will talk about how the BBVA storage team started its OpenStack journey and what kind of challenges they faced. We will discuss how the Storage team  overcame both technological and cultural challenges and what did they learn from these experiences. Then we will go on and discuss the architecture and use cases for the cloud deployment at BBVA and will focus on what kind of storage architectural decisions were taken and the reasons for such decisions.
