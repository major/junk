Upgrading Clouds with Fuel and Octane: AT&T's Diesel Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) program faced a challenge of upgrading deployed Mirantis OpenStack clouds without migrating tenants and moving to a new reference architecture without redeploying from scratch. Â Leveraging Octane, an open source project to upgrade Fuel nodes, the Diesel (Fuel + Octane) development team was able to create an automated procedure that would result in an upgraded OpenStack cloud. In this talk, the members of the development team explain their challenges, setbacks, and successes of achieving OpenStack upgrades.
