SpringCM's experience delivering document management on Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SpringCM is a cloud platform that manages documents, contracts and all related collateral. Delivering this SaaS application to users puts great demands on infrastructure, on top of the architectural demands to deliver a great user experience at the right cost for our business. We saw Swift as a great infrastructure fit when building our offering.
