Lessons from the trenches - onboarding customers and  workloads  to OpenStack private clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

After a customer is provided a managed private cloud based on OpenStack , we often get a question from the customer around "Now what do we do to get our workload onboarded ?" The typical challenges we have seen include - Level of OpenStack exposure needed for end users - including Horizon vs Custom portals - Migration of existing VMs with minimum disruption - including compatibility of VM formats - Application deployment mechanisms - including  automation considerations and containers - Hybrid scenarios - dealing with workloads that span across hybrid clouds - Tuning the stack based on workload considerations We will share the lessons learnt and real world customer case studies , including some of  the common pitfalls that break workload onboarding to OpenStack  and how to avoid them.
