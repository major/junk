Deploying OpenStack for an NAVENT  RealEstate and Jobs Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  Navent Group was established to provide the highest quality jobs and real estate online listings to people living in Latin America, as a majority of listings in the region are currently only available in print. The company was founded in 2010 with a mission to help its users find work and housing options. It owns five job classifieds websites: Bumeran, Konzerta, Multitrabajos, UniversoBit, and Curriculum, the most popular of which is Bumeran.com.Bumeran has over 5 million individual users per month and lists over 50,000 job postings.   We have been working with them deploying OpenStack, Ceph and Swift to manage DEV teams, Production Sites and gain agility to the business.   The idea is to show how we helped them on this process and discuss why we choose OpenStack instead of others solutions.
