Hybrid Cloud migration and recovery using OpenStack Smaug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

 The ability to implement a comprehensive DR solution is a critical requirement for enterprise-grade readiness. OpenStack Smaug provides a framework of APIs and services to orchestrate data protection and recovery of all the entities that comprise a production site.  Smaug APIs simplify the process of building a viable Disaster Recovery mechanism between the running site and an independent DRP site, that runs in a completely separate OpenStack instance. In this session, we will share how Huawei uses OpenStack Smaug in its Hybrid Cloud solution to implement a cross-cloud disaster recovery, helping its customers to protect their data in the public cloud, or on another private cloud, while retaining a very short “back to business” time, in case of a service outage.
