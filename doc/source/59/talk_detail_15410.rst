Service Function Chaining for vCPE with OpenStack and Software Defined Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Service providers and the broader vendor community have made progress in virtualizing key vCPE network functions. Concurrently, there is a strong push to bring these functions to the cloud. This session will discuss how Openstack is enabling this transformation and the role played by technologies like SDN and NFV. It will also discuss the latest advances in the networking stack of the Linux kernel which further enable these network functions to run in a fully distributed architecture. Finally, it will tie all these concepts together proposing a model for implementing virtual CPE services.
