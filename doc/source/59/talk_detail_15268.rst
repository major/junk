Let's Oversubscribe the OpenStack environment and try to find the weaknesses and improvements.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Oversubscription of SDI is not a trivial problem.Numerous questions to be answered and tradeoffs to be fine-tuned.Is it worth to stressing the environment to the max?Where are the limits and bottlenecks? Let's find the sweet-point of the performance-SLA pair!As the OpenStack Performance Team we've executed countless tests and gathered gigabytes of data to verify that. During the talk we will present new open testing framework that we have developed.*It's features include running workloads in different conditions,measuring them and visualize.*We will describe the methodology and show the analysis of stack under the businesses line applications stress.According to the Delft University of Technology:"CPU utilization is higher than memory utilization,which is the opposite of the finding of Diet for the Google trace.This is because that business-critical workloads are more in line with grid workloads".You will walk out of this presentation knowing exactly who is right in this dispute.
