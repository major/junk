~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Turkcell is the leading mobile network operator in Turkey and also offers additional internet services to its users. One of these services is Akıllı Depo, a service to store and share important documents, photos, videos and other media files in the cloud. In 2015 Turkcell upgraded their offering and therefore needed a storage system that is- easily accessible from apps and web-browsers; - is built with a strong durability, high availability and scalability in mind;- stores data replicated across multiple datacenters;- and can be enhanced using software developed in-house.During this talk, we want to give you an overview and introduction to OpenStack Swift, an open-source object storage system, and how it is used and operated to empower Turkcell's offerings using the Red Hat OpenStack platform.
