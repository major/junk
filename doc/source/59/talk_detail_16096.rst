Optimizing Cloud Resources leveraging OpenStack Watcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Watcher is an OpenStack Big Tent project which provides a flexible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds. Watcher provides a robust framework to realize a wide range of cloud optimization goals, including the reduction of data center operating costs, increased system performance via intelligent virtual machine migration and increased energy efficiency.  In this session we will share some interesting use cases and challenges Walmart has experienced running one of the largest private cloud environments, and how watcher can be used as a resource optimization infrastructure. We will demonstrate how Watcher integrates with other OpenStack subsystems like nova scheduler and host aggregates. We will present how watcher can provide some interesting optimization use cases and capabilities: Workload consolidation and balancing Resource Prioritization, QoS and optimization strategies Datacenter energy conservation
