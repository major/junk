OpenStack Journey in Tieto Elastic Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

  Tieto is the #1 cloud service provider in Northern Europe with over 150 cloud customers in the region. Turnover is approximately €1.5 billion. Chronicle our journey to a new operational meta for our OpenStack cloud. From humble beginnings, follow our path to operational freedom and the security of knowing that every change is proven and can be deployed safely at any time. See how we’ve built on the OpenStack-salt project along with utilizing CI/CD pipelines to allow upstream bug fixes, security patching, service lifecycle management all off a git commit. The session will feature live demos so come prepared to be blown away.
