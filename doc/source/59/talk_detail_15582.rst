Why you shouldn't fork OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Following upstream is not easy.There are training sessions and mentoring to help but sometimes the problem is not knowing how to do it but not having time to do it properly. As cloud operators we have day to day constraints and we often need to fix and patch as soon as possible which is not really compatible with upstream at first look. After more than one year in production with many internal patches, we learned that we have no other choice than committing upstream our previous and future modifications and that's why we need a smart solution to do what we couldn't do before.We don't want to maintain our fork of OpenStack so we are currently improving this contribution process and we would like to share our mistakes and discoveries on our journey with OpenStack.
