Experiences building a Public Cloud with OpenStack and LinuxONE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The LinuxONE Community Cloud is just under a year old and already supports 1000+ users worldwide. It's open to anyone who wants a free trial of a Linux virtual server, with an interest in touching a real-life LinuxONE machine. How is this possible? With OpenStack, of course! OpenStack, running on the IBM z/VM hypervisor, underpins this growing public cloud. In this session we will discuss the architecture of the LinuxONE Community Cloud, challenges in setting it up and tending it and how it has grown.  We'll also discuss the joys and sorrows of running OpenStack on a non x86 KVM platform and lessons learned from that. We'll include demos of our custom built self-service dashboard based on OpenStack Horizon which allows users to provision a variety of Linux distributions. After you hear about it, you might even want to try it yourself. You too can start playing with all the latest technologies like Blockchain, Apache Spark and all the other buzzwords we can fit into this description!

* **John Arwe** *(I've grunged around in the mainframe kernels (z/OS SRM/WLM mostly, recently a bit of z/VM and zKVM) for many years, and took a wide detour doing standards and open source work (W3C SML and LDP, OSLC, OASIS, DMTF, Eclipse, REST APIs, Linked Data) in the middle. Lately I've been schizophrenically focused on both the z/VM nova CI system and architecting/debugging client deployments of the OpenStack and hypervisor back-end components.)*
