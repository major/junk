People, Process, and Technology: Oh My!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is a tool, and tools are meant to do one thing well. Unfortunately, a tool isn't enough to solve business problems. People and processes are more important than the right tool. This talk will address how to work with the people and processes needed to succeed with cloud.  We will: Explain challenges with people (governance) Explain challenges with processes (waterfall to agile) Offer solutions and best practices This session discusses a specific solution that can be used by organizations to increase agility. It is a how to, not a philosophical discussion What can I expect to learn? It will: Organizational best practices to help with people Development changes (waterfall to agile) Process changes to give power to each person/organization
