Object-Based Genomics: Building a Distributed, Fault-Tolerant NGS workflow with OpenStack Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Learn how Counsyl revamped its NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) analysis pipeline from dependence on expensive, single point of failure centralized block storage to a highly scalable storage cloud that is resilient to failures and able to be run on commodity hardware. We will also discuss key optimizations for running genomics workflows to and from OpenStack Swift, current and future support for object workflows in tooling, and preview Counsyl’s soon-to-be open-sourced tool, stor, which allowed them to transparently rewrite posix-based python code to work with the native Swift and S3 APIs.
