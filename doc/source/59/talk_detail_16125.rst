Developing for OpenStack APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Building a cloud orchestrator is not like building any other cloud application. Not because it is more challenging, they’re all challenging...but because an orchestrator needs to expose the full range of functionality that the underlying cloud exposes. If the orchestrator can't provide the full range of cloud services, what good is it ultimately? That is why integrating with the cloud SDK correctly requires users to have access to the full range of API functions and parameters through the orchestration template. In this talk we’ll describe the techniques we used to expose the full OpenStack SDK to Cloudify blueprints, some of the pitfalls encountered, and how we overcame them.
