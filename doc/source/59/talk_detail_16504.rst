Customer Case Study: How TechAccelerator used OpenStack as a better alternative to vCloud Director
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With vCloud Director approaching the end of its life, enterprises are increasingly looking at alternatives to satisfy their cloud goals atop existing VMware infrastructure investments. One such company is TechAccelerator - a solutions provider that empowers enterprises with an easy-to-use, on-demand, hands-on platform to speed up product adoption and solution integration. Given the rate at which these lab environments need to be dynamically spun up and destroyed, it is also important to be able to deploy them with a single-click, and clean them up.
