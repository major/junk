Networking Down Under: Proving OpenStack across a large-scale academic research network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NeCTAR is an Australian Government project conducted as part of the Super Science initiative, and led by the University of Melbourne. NeCTAR was an early adopter of OpenStack Essex, using nova-networking. They knew that migration from nova-networking to Neutron would be challenging. NeCTAR knew they wanted an open-source Neutron plugin from a vendor with excellent community credibility. Running OpenStack at scale with over 7000 instances, 1000 hosts, across 10 datacenters, NeCTAR needed a solution that was easy to install and provided both basic networking features and advanced services that can handle such scale. They chose MidoNet.

* **Sam Morrison** *(Sam Morrison is the Technical lead for the NeCTAR Research Cloud, which spans 9 different datacentres across Australia. In this role he is responsible for coordinating the technical team's activities in each location, in addition to OpenStack customisation work. As happy managing government funding milestone expectations as diving into python code, Sam is a contributor to nova, horizon, cinder, keystone, glance, ceilometer and trove. His latest hobby is migrating nova-network clouds to neutron.)*
