Legacy architectures to an automated, multi-tenant private cloud: EBSCO Case Study
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

I heard that implementing OpenStack is not for the faint of heart. As IT architect at EBSCO, I will draw upon our recent experience with implementing OpenStack at EBSCO to share best practices that I discovered along the way. You will learn both the technology and organizational barriers that need to be overcome to create a robust private cloud implementation with OpenStack.
