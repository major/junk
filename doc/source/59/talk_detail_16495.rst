One cloud. Openstack.  Kubernetes. One hour. A managed OpenStack success story.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is hard.  At least it has been for some time.  It requires resources to manage and expert knowledge on-site, and downtime remains a nagging fear. With the proliferation of containers, cloud teams now have to manage two systems, with 4X (2^2) the worry. Indeed, the “OpenStack or containers?” question consumes further resources in unproductive debate. No longer.  Dell, Platform9 and Midokura have teamed to delivered a solution that is easy to deploy, leverages SDN, minimizes resource overhead, reduces TCO, and best of all: unifies OpenStack and Kubernetes workload management within a single interface
