How to embrace hybrid cloud without giving up OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For enterprises running OpenStack based private cloud, adding public cloud resources is an attractive proposition. A hybrid cloud offers pay-as-you-go flexibility of a public cloud combined with security and privacy of a private cloud. However, the complexity poses a barrier to its adoption. In this talk, we show how to use the OpenStack API layer as the unifying interface for hybrid-cloud management. We found that this approach solves a number of use cases for managing workloads on public cloud like AWS. It enables uniform experience, simplicity and portability for cloud tooling and applications. We have extended the OpenStack control pane by building AWS-specific drivers for Nova, Glance, Cinder and Neutron. We added Platform9’s brownfield discovery technology to further ease the ingestion of AWS workloads into an OpenStack-driven cloud. This approach can easily be extended to other clouds as well, making the holy grail of multi-cloud a reality.
