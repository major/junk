~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session you will learn how Amadeus IT Group, a multi-national IT provider for global travel and tourism with over 3 billion euro in revenue, undertook a transformational project to modernize their infrastructure. We will go through some of the drivers for the project and technology choices evaluated for the project. You will learn how and why Amadeus chose OpenStack over AWS, Private Cloud with Chef / Puppet based automation.   After deciding to go with OpenStack, we will go through why Amadeus decided to go with VMware Integrated OpenStack and NSX for this critical project. We will then share the high level design and best practices Amadeus implemented and learnt from this project.
