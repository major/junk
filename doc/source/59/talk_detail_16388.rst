Case Study: Enabling CI/CD for a Future of Connected Cars at one of the World’s Largest Automakers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One of the world’s largest automakers chose OpenStack to build their cloud in response to the industry shift to a service economy. As part of this project, they needed to stand up a mix of business and consumer-facing applications, that would be used by supplier and dealer networks as well as related brands under their umbrella. They built their cloud platform to deliver digital transformation and enable CI/CD to build a future with connected cars.
