Deep dive into Keystone Tokens   - Which is best for large-scale production environment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

   Now, we know keystone supports four different types of tokens, UUID, PKI, PKIZ and Fernet. Which is best for large-scale production environment?    In China Mobile public Cloud, We have built two cluster at different region - 1000 nodes in each cluster which contains 6 keystone nodes for high availability. We have done a lot of performance tests with different types of  tokens. Based on these results, we have  made careful analysis and lots of improvements for large-scale production enviroment.
