Efficient Business Analysis for an OpenStack-based Multitenant Public Cloud Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We at NTT Communications provide the public/hosted private cloud service Enterprise Cloud 2.0 based on OpenStack in five countries, and planning to expand further globally. Business analysis is crucial to expand business all over the world for a public cloud service provider with OpenStack because each country has different user trends. Questions like what is the most popular flavor or most used OS provides crucial data in resource management and stock monitoring. However, it is not easy to gather and analyze these data using only OpenStack. In order to implement effective business analysis for global service management and expansion, we have designed a service architecture using a system which gathers, stores and analyzes OpenStack usage data in a global scale. In this session, we will show which OpenStack data are crucial for our business analysis, and our approach to utilize these data for effective global management and expansion of our public cloud service.
