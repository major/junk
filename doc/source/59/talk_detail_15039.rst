Building a Private Cloud for Tripsta.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Tripsta is building its own private cloud environment targeting to migrate all of their current workload by the end of 2016. For the time being the company IT services are relied upon bare-metal offerings from a third-party provider. The size of the allocated infrastructure resources is approximately 140 physical servers. The company decided to modernize its IT operations with OpenStack, while they are already transitioned into an Infrastructure as Code model with the help of SaltStack. As a consequence of their competent knowledge in configuration management and orchestration, as well as for simplicity matters they have built their OpenStack cloud in their own. In this endeavor Tripsta works closely with Stackmasters, who have undertaken the task to quickly enable the project team into performing comprehensively as part of their OpenStack consulting and support services.
