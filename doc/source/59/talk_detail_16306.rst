OpenStack and the US Army or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bureaucracy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When one thinks of business agility, maximizing productivity, and bleeding-edge technology, one generally doesn't think of the United States Army.  In fact, some people might imagine that an organization with 1.38 million employees would be the exact opposite of agile.  Some people might imagine a crushing bureaucracy that snuffs out innovation in favor of policy and procedure.  Some people might imagine a myriad of internal organizations whose sole purpose is to tell you why you can't do something.  Some people might even imagine that there would be exactly zero internal support for anything that deviates from "normal". These people would be absolutely correct. Yet, a fully functioning (and rapidly growing) OpenStack deployment is at the heart of the training program at the United States Army Cyber School.  Come learn how we navigated this project through one of the most innovation-unfriendly organizations on earth, how we use OpenStack, and where we plan to go from here.
