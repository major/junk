Why We Chose OpenStack As our Hybrid Cloud Management Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AVG Technologies is a leader in internet security software, providing security software that protects devices for families and businesses worldwide. As part of supporting a high velocity software development model, the AVG team needed to leverage internal infrastructure and public cloud while accelerating CI/CD and automation using a common API. It was clear to them that OpenStack could fully manage their private infrastructure across VMware and KVM, and integrating with Cisco ACI. But what about the need for a single platform across public and private clouds? Other hybrid CMPs were an option but they have a lot of overlap in functionality with OpenStack and the AVG team prefers using OpenStack API due to compatibility with devops tools they use. So they asked themselves: why not consolidate using OpenStack? This talk will highlight how AVG was able to collaborate within the community to build AWS-specific drivers for OpenStack to deliver a fully hybrid implementation at AVG.
