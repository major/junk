Multi-location Cloud Health Tracking - Building an Operations Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will cover a custom approach to tracking cloud health across many geo-locations. There are multiple OpenStack solutions for monitoring, but these tend to focus on single-location, with an opinionated approach to the data they collect and how they collect it. We have investigated various methods of extracting metrics from all the OpenStack IaaS and PaaS components, and built a custom dashboard to display this data from the 75+ OpenStack clouds deployed inside AT&T. The dashboard allows both users and operators to see the data they need, in order to maintain their applications and services across multiple locations.
