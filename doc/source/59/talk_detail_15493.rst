Moving from productivity to profitability: winning clients with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has changed the way the world builds & integrates cloud technologies. For you, it's changed the way you do business by bringing you value through a robust & interoperable foundation for cloud. How do you help your customers realize the value that OpenStack can bring to their business? In this non-technical session targeted to executives & sellers, we will discuss several approaches they can use to introduce, demo, and position OpenStack to three types of hypothetical customers: a customer with no knowledge of cloud or OpenStack, a customer with knowledge of cloud but no knowledge of OpenStack, and finally, a customer with knowledge of cloud and misconceptions of OpenStack. In addition we will provide proven strategies that attendees can use to introduce and discuss OpenStack within their own organizations.
