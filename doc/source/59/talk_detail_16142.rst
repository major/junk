**Abstract:**

In building an OpenStack team, policies and procedures are often implemented once the team has been built and deployed.  This session will give users tools to implement policies and procedures that can cover multiple teams and multiple cloud platforms.  Building a solid foundation for an OpenStack team sets them up for success from the beginning.
