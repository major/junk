Sharing resources with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We all know how virtualization solves the problem of unused server resources, but what happens when a your organization is made up of scientists, each of whom needs the resources of a computing behemoth to do his or her job? In this session, we'll look at how Naturalis uses OpenStack to enable administrators to easily share computing resources among scientists while avoiding both wasted resources and the hassles of buying and managing an inordinate number of powerful workstations. We'll also look at how we make use of features such as host aggregates, post-install scripts, and the OpenStack API to provide an environment where scientists can safely test and repeat their calculations.
