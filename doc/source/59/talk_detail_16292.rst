Running OpenStack on Bare Meta Provider - Case Study - Packet.net
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Renting hardware instead of owning it is increasingly becoming popular -- and providers like Rackspace, Softlayer, OVH & Packet enable the building of Private Clouds with rented hardware.  Using a bare metal provider as the foundation of a private cloud can save you the hassle of owning hardware, allow for highly automated private cloud environments and strong operational models.  This talk consists of a case study of deploying OpenStack on Packet (www.packet.net) and dives into key deployment considerations and technical hurdles. You will learn about security issues, networking models in deploying OpenStack on a public bare metal provider and solution(s) Platform9 (www.platform9.com) employed to overcome some of these challenges.  Using public bare metal providers can be beneficial both in terms of cost and flexibility.
