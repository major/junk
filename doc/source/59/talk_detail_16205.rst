No team? No problem! (How a single admin manages 70 OpenStack nodes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One complaint we always hear about OpenStack is that managing an big environment takes a team of people, but we've found that it's simply not true. In this talk, you'll see how switching to OpenStack actually saved us time and money by replacing a few dozen workstations with just two OpenStack clusters that consist of 70 nodes -- all managed by a single admin. More than that, though, we'll talk about issues you're likely to face and how to solve them, as well as what we needed to do to make it possible for one person to manage all of these resources.
