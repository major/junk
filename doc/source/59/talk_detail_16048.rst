Balance workloads for optimal performance with Watcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Watcher is an open source software package which provides a flexible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds. Watcher provides a complete optimization loop. This provides a robust framework to realize a wide range of resource optimization goals. The project joined the big tent recently. We tested Watcher on a 50 hosts cluster in September 2016 and this talk will give you the main outputs we learned from this experiment.
