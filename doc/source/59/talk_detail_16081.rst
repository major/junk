Deploying OpenStack Networks for Financial use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As IT organizations look to the cloud to reduce costs and provide greater agility to their business units, theyâ€™re also responsible for the security, and regulatory compliance of the systems that they build. This can be a daunting task, particularly for Financial Institutions which have the added responsibility of ensuring the security of their customers' financial information. In this presentation, attendees will learn how one large financial institution is solving these seemingly competing priorities through automation, micro-segmentation, and security in depth with Openstack and SDN.
