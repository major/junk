5 Years of OpenStack Managed Service at SAP SE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In 2011, B1 Systems began evaluating OpenStack vs. SAP's traditional script-based Xen hosting solution. The projectstarted off as a PoC based on OpenStack Bexar. In 2012, B1 built a fully-fledged OpenStack production environment with +200 hypervisors and 135TB of memory.For more than four years, B1 has been operating and providing support for SAP's OpenStack landscape.Since then, a total redesign of SAP's OpenStack landscape has taken place in order to benefit from OpenStack's fast development pace.The migration of two thousand VMs from Folsom to Icehouse was but one of the major milestones.This environment features OpenStack customizations, a workflow engine and an enduser frontend (B1 Cloud Portal) tailor-made for SAP, thus integrating the new environment with thousands of VMs seamlessly intothe existing SAP infrastructure.SAP and B1 Systems will share their OpenStack journey - includingtheir experiences regarding customizations, operation and upgrades.
