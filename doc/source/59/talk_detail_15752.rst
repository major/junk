~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It can be easy to come up with a TCO analysis that would challenge any public cloud and make you think, "let's go in-house!". What are the challenges and is it really worth it? The TubeMogul Operation team went thru the technical challenges at building a private cloud. In this presentation you will learn how the team went from a R&D to an automated deployment of a bare-metal servers to finally migrate a large workload from a Public Cloud to its own Private Cloud infrastructure. We will detail how the team dealt with unexpected issues and also how we chose the hardware, estimated capacity, stay cost effective, improve overall performance of the system, and bring better control and visibility.
