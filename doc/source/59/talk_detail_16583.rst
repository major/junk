Case Study: Building a fully automated developer workflow using OpenStack on VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Alert Logic is a leader in security and compliance solutions for the cloud, providing Security-as-a-Service for on-premises, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures powering enterprises worldwide. The IT team inside Alert Logic standardized on VMware as their private infrastructure of choice for it’s stability and performance. However, they had to build a significant amount of automation inhouse (a ruby on rails application) to automate deployment of workloads on a variety of platforms – Vmware, AWS, LXC etc. all their deployment tools interacted directly with VMware vCenter. And the automation still did not fix the need for end-users to have direct access to vCenter for console and other use cases. This conflicted with Alert Logic’s policy of doing everything as-a-service and enabling self-serve model for users. This talk describes Alert Logic’s use case of building a powerful automation using OpenStack with VMware, and ruby on rails with chef to automate their developer workflows.
