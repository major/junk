OpenStack integration proccess to super conservatives: case of social infrastructure corporation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Adoptation of OpenStack by super conservatives is the most difficult case. Super conservative company has complex business process, very sensitive to system reliability, hates confusion generated by changes and for the most they have the history of operating own systems in a closed environment. Thus, making a decision of adopting Openstack have to overcome barrier within the organization. In order for those companies to adopt Openstack, it is crucial to change the conservative mind set of their corporate culture to be more open minded. In this session, I would like to share the challenges which we facing right now on how to start and induce cultural shift in an organization, and also discuss methodologies and approaches which we are taking so far.I believe that our experience has larger benefit for many Stackers.And I hope exchanging information and sharing problems through our discussion contributes to a growth of Openstack World.
