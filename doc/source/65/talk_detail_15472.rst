What we learned along the way: Internap's history with OpenStack and our plans for the future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In early 2014, Internap was at a crossroads: either we would continue writing, maintaining and supporting our internal cloud platform or we would find an alternative. While searching, we kept coming back to this intriguing, well-publicized and yet mysterious and growing community: OpenStack. It was so intriguing that we took the leap of faith and joined! But, being the newb on the block, we had a very long road unfolding ahead of us: how to adopt and embrace all the benefits of this new family. This is the story of our journey: from complete stranger, to enthusiastic user, to regular contributor and all the lessons we learned along the way.
