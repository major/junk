Cloud and Corporate Culture Clash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T has experienced a shock to the way things have been done for years.  OpenStack is creating opportunities to evaluate and change slow manual processes that have existed for over a decade.  This presentation will show how OpenStack helped bring about change through the efforts to automate everything starting with design and deployment to sustainment and expansion.  We will explore the development of AIC Formation, a tool that reduced design from weeks to under 10 minutes.
