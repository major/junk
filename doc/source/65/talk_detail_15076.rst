Making Open Source Mode Accessible.... One Women's T-shirt at a Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The number of women involved in open source technologies has increased slightly in the last decade, but clearly not enough to drive longer lines at the women’s restrooms or increase the distribution of women’s T-shirts at today’s popular open source events. In this session, Johanna Koester, Program Director of Open Technology and Amy Hermes, Program Director of Technical Eminence at IBM, share best practices and lessons learned around making open source more accessible to women. Open source organizations, IT vendors and end users alike will benefit from a deeper understanding of what it takes to increase not only the number of women in technology but also the level of engagement of women across organizations and ecosystems. Learn what should become the “meets min” from open source foundations, organizations where you work and companies you interact with… including that “right-sized” T-shirt!
