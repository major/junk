AT&T's Upstream Journey: Open Source within a Fortune 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T has seen an increase of 54x in commits, 10x in reviews, and 14x in drafted blueprints. Well over half of all contributions have come from a group consisting mostly of new hires. This effort began with three engineers and has since grown to thirty dedicated members in the first half of 2016. Most notably, these results have occurred within the walls of a Fortune 10, historically associated with conservative decisions rather than open source dedication. There is an absolute tide turning in the software culture at AT&T from all levels and it is to that of openness. The presenters in this talk are the original members of AT&T’s Community team. We have gone from fresh OpenStackers to taking on all steps required to contribute and grow the team by ten-fold. We have run the gambit on changing culture and breaking down roadblocks to enable open source efforts. We still have a long way to go, but we know our results and experiences can be invaluable to others in the community.
