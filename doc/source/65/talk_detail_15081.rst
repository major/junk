Inside the Developer Persona: What are they thinking?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It’s a question all of us in the business of marketing OpenStack ask ourselves: How do we win over the developers? Not the OpenStack developers, but the developers at our target companies. The ones who have nothing to do with OpenStack. We want them to advocate for OpenStack-based (presumably private) cloud solutions—to win over the decision-makers in their respective IT organizations. But is that realistic? Do they care what clouds their companies use? What do they know about OpenStack? Where do they get their information? Are they so comfortable with the major public cloud offerings that they’re going to resist any kind of change at all? Are we just spinning our wheels trying to communicate with them? In this session, Ali Amagasu, OpenStack marketer for Cisco Systems (and previously Metacloud) will ask a panel of developers all those questions and more in an effort to figure out what they need, whether we can give it to them, and how we should go about communicating it.

She then moved on to OpenStack startup Metacloud, where she was the original marketing hire. There she built an end-to-end marketing function that took the company all the way from it's seed-funded status to a successful Series A funding round, a bigger Series B, and eventual acquisition by Cisco Systems.  Today Ali is part of Cisco's Corporate Marketing organization, where she serves as an SME for Metapod, and happily knocks herself out every day educating people about the value in her company's core cloud offering.)*
