How Walmart is building a successful open source culture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Walmart started its OpenStack journey with our eCommerce site.  Open source is a priority in our approach to new development and embracing new solutions.  We want to share our journey as we continue to build a successful open source culture, making it a focused and integral part of our day to day planning, operation and execution.  We will explore our successes and failures as we continue to grow our community involvement and participation.
