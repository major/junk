Let’s make the work place more diverse! How to hire a more diverse team for success.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When we talk about the benefits of diversity, we frequently cite studies of companies like the 2009 UIC study concluding racial and gender diversity are associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, and greater relative profits.  A panel of company people leaders will bring this conversation down from the macro scale to discuss their personal experiences where building a diverse team has positively impacted product delivery and contributed to success.  These strong leaders will give advice on successfully finding and hiring talent to create a diverse team.  A report published in the Oct 2010 Science magazine showed a greater proportion of women in a group was associated with higher collective intelligence, defined as “the general ability of a group to perform a wide variety of tasks.”    Is it better to intentionally seek out and hire women to raise a team’s collective intelligence, or should diversity be encouraged organically by working to reduce bias in hiring?
