From OpenStack Rookie to OpenStack Rockstar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Do you have a multi-tiered organization in need of OpenStack training? Are your OpenStack skills disproportionately concentrated within a single team? Are you having trouble educating your product and sales teams on OpenStack and open source technologies? If so, then this session is for you. Join us as we take you through the lessons we learned from our mission to bring OpenStack skills to a wide variety of teams across multiple geographies inside of IBM. We will show you how we created a scalable and customizable education model that includes hands on access to test environments to address the needs of those who will engage customers in pre-sale activity, those who will consume the technology as they develop cloud solutions, and those who will develop code and contribute back into the community. This approach has helped us educate nearly 300 IBMers internally at a predictable cost per student, and resulted in 10,000 lines of code contributed externally.

He is also a co-organizer of the OpenStack New York and OpenStack Connecticut user groups. )*
