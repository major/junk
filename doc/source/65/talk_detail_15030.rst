Why Enterprises Want Containers Now (and why you should too)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It took enterprises a decade or more to embrace virtualization. It was a massive, quantum leap from the mindset of one server, one OS, one workload. Virtualization was a relatively easy sell: cost compression was the name of the game, and no one played the game better than VMware. But once the public cloud (AWS, etc.) and open source options (OpenStack, etc.)  came along, enterprises had to fundamentally shift the way they thought about application development and deployment, as well as infrastructure operations. It was a big shift. It took time. But once enterprises “got it,” things started to change. Why have containers caught on faster than VMs? Do enterprises want both? What lessons can we learn from early mistakes the pioneers have made in containers deployment? This session will provide a better understanding on how enterprises—in growing numbers—have crossed the barrier and are thinking “cloudy” about app dev and ops, leading them to ask, “Do we even need VMs?”
