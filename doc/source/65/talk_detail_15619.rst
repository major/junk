Upgrading OpenStack Millennium Edition to OpenStack XP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every successful software company thrives when there’s a good mix of talented senior engineers and entry-level engineers. However, when today's curriculum focuses around AI and mobile development, it can be hard to find talented college students interested in cloud. Let's say you do find a new hire willing to jump into the vast unknown that is OpenStack; how do you take that engineer and bring them up in a fast-paced environment without overwhelming them and driving them away?  Attendees will walk away with the do's and don'ts for hiring and developing young talent from those who've gone through the process first hand. We'll talk about our experiences that include: starting out as new hires tasked with developing IBM's public cloud, joining a more experienced team (Blue Box), and taking on critical roles within the organization. We'll also discuss our experience recruiting and mentoring new hires and interns, giving them the tools and knowledge to succeed in the OpenStack environment.
