SAP's DevOps Journey: from building an app to building a cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SAP has been using a DevOps & Continuous Delivery approach for building its web and mobile apps for several years, and in the Cloud Infrastructure Service we are now building and running a global cloud at the scale needed to run not only SAP's internal business applications but also the cloud applications used by over 100 million people at SAP's 300,000 customers. In this talk we tell the story of how SAP originally adopted DevOps practices with a simple pilot. That pilot included a bare-bones DevOps platform which evolved through several stages to become a next-generation open-source-based cloud and deployment automation system using OpenStack and Kubernetes. At each stage of the journey we examine the technical and organisational challenges we faced and share how we overcame them. The most important lesson of all? Ultimately, it's about the people.

Together with Nigel James he co-founded the SAP Inside Track movement of grassroots conferences, then wrote a book on SAP’s Universal Worklist software and finally joined SAP itself in 2008. Initially he worked on SAP’s developer portal before becoming an architect of the SAP Cloud ID service, the first of SAP’s projects to use DevOps and Continuous Delivery principles. More recently he joined the Cloud Infrastructure Services team which is responsible for building and operating SAP's OpenStack-based global cloud platform using Kubernetes-managed Docker containers.)*
