**Abstract:**

The process of moving from a traditional IT environment to an agile cloud environment presents many new opportunities but is accompanied by many challenges. Such an exciting transformation requires fundamental changes to your organizational structure, processes and culture. You will need to rethink how you do daily business and ask yourself  if anything your are doing today will be relevant in a cloud environment. As you embark on this journey, you will often find more questions raised than answered. By attending this talk you will walk away with an understanding of how and where you can start the process, the resources you will most likely need and a way to manage the progress to an agile enterprise cloud environment.
