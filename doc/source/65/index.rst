OpenStack integration proccess to super conservatives: case of social infrastructure corporation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Adoptation of OpenStack by super conservatives is the most difficult case. Super conservative company has complex business process, very sensitive to system reliability, hates confusion generated by changes and for the most they have the history of operating own systems in a closed environment. Thus, making a decision of adopting Openstack have to overcome barrier within the organization. In order for those companies to adopt Openstack, it is crucial to change the conservative mind set of their corporate culture to be more open minded. In this session, I would like to share the challenges which we facing right now on how to start and induce cultural shift in an organization, and also discuss methodologies and approaches which we are taking so far.I believe that our experience has larger benefit for many Stackers.And I hope exchanging information and sharing problems through our discussion contributes to a growth of Openstack World.

Why Enterprises Want Containers Now (and why you should too)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It took enterprises a decade or more to embrace virtualization. It was a massive, quantum leap from the mindset of one server, one OS, one workload. Virtualization was a relatively easy sell: cost compression was the name of the game, and no one played the game better than VMware. But once the public cloud (AWS, etc.) and open source options (OpenStack, etc.)  came along, enterprises had to fundamentally shift the way they thought about application development and deployment, as well as infrastructure operations. It was a big shift. It took time. But once enterprises “got it,” things started to change. Why have containers caught on faster than VMs? Do enterprises want both? What lessons can we learn from early mistakes the pioneers have made in containers deployment? This session will provide a better understanding on how enterprises—in growing numbers—have crossed the barrier and are thinking “cloudy” about app dev and ops, leading them to ask, “Do we even need VMs?”

Making Open Source Mode Accessible.... One Women's T-shirt at a Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The number of women involved in open source technologies has increased slightly in the last decade, but clearly not enough to drive longer lines at the women’s restrooms or increase the distribution of women’s T-shirts at today’s popular open source events. In this session, Johanna Koester, Program Director of Open Technology and Amy Hermes, Program Director of Technical Eminence at IBM, share best practices and lessons learned around making open source more accessible to women. Open source organizations, IT vendors and end users alike will benefit from a deeper understanding of what it takes to increase not only the number of women in technology but also the level of engagement of women across organizations and ecosystems. Learn what should become the “meets min” from open source foundations, organizations where you work and companies you interact with… including that “right-sized” T-shirt!

Inside the Developer Persona: What are they thinking?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It’s a question all of us in the business of marketing OpenStack ask ourselves: How do we win over the developers? Not the OpenStack developers, but the developers at our target companies. The ones who have nothing to do with OpenStack. We want them to advocate for OpenStack-based (presumably private) cloud solutions—to win over the decision-makers in their respective IT organizations. But is that realistic? Do they care what clouds their companies use? What do they know about OpenStack? Where do they get their information? Are they so comfortable with the major public cloud offerings that they’re going to resist any kind of change at all? Are we just spinning our wheels trying to communicate with them? In this session, Ali Amagasu, OpenStack marketer for Cisco Systems (and previously Metacloud) will ask a panel of developers all those questions and more in an effort to figure out what they need, whether we can give it to them, and how we should go about communicating it.

There she built an end-to-end marketing function that took the company all the way from it's seed-funded status to a successful Series A funding round, a bigger Series B, and eventual acquisition by Cisco Systems.  Today Ali is part of Cisco's Corporate Marketing organization, where she serves as an SME for Metapod, and happily knocks herself out every day educating people about the value in her company's core cloud offering.)*

From OpenStack Rookie to OpenStack Rockstar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Do you have a multi-tiered organization in need of OpenStack training? Are your OpenStack skills disproportionately concentrated within a single team? Are you having trouble educating your product and sales teams on OpenStack and open source technologies? If so, then this session is for you. Join us as we take you through the lessons we learned from our mission to bring OpenStack skills to a wide variety of teams across multiple geographies inside of IBM. We will show you how we created a scalable and customizable education model that includes hands on access to test environments to address the needs of those who will engage customers in pre-sale activity, those who will consume the technology as they develop cloud solutions, and those who will develop code and contribute back into the community. This approach has helped us educate nearly 300 IBMers internally at a predictable cost per student, and resulted in 10,000 lines of code contributed externally.


* **Vince Brunssen** *(I currently work in the OpenStack Open Source community where I manage a group of 17 developers who contribute code to various project.  I also work on the OpenStack project myself, contributing where I am able to do so.  In the time when I am not working on OpenStack I also like to work with other technologies such as Cloud Foundry and Bluemix.  I find it interesting how we can now use IaaS and PaaS to quickly and easily create applications, try them out, and use the result or toss it aside depending on the outcome.  This ability to quickly and easily develop, test and iterate on code in an agile manner is where it is at in Software Development.)*

SAP's DevOps Journey: from building an app to building a cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

SAP has been using a DevOps & Continuous Delivery approach for building its web and mobile apps for several years, and in the Cloud Infrastructure Service we are now building and running a global cloud at the scale needed to run not only SAP's internal business applications but also the cloud applications used by over 100 million people at SAP's 300,000 customers. In this talk we tell the story of how SAP originally adopted DevOps practices with a simple pilot. That pilot included a bare-bones DevOps platform which evolved through several stages to become a next-generation open-source-based cloud and deployment automation system using OpenStack and Kubernetes. At each stage of the journey we examine the technical and organisational challenges we faced and share how we overcame them. The most important lesson of all? Ultimately, it's about the people.

Initially he worked on SAP’s developer portal before becoming an architect of the SAP Cloud ID service, the first of SAP’s projects to use DevOps and Continuous Delivery principles. More recently he joined the Cloud Infrastructure Services team which is responsible for building and operating SAP's OpenStack-based global cloud platform using Kubernetes-managed Docker containers.)*

How to lose clients and alienate coworkers - lessons learned on an OpenStack enterprise journey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It's not a smooth road to getting customers and developers to OpenStack. This session focuses on the missteps and the maybe next times, such as: How not to introduce OpenStack to your existing customers. Enterprises are sometimes shy about changing the paradigm by which they manage their core computing resources. Migration, security, long-term plans are all important. Making your team hate developing in the open. Devs who worked on proprietary systems don't always embrace the open source ethos. How do you get them to create blueprints, love IRC and go to conferences? Not playing nicely with the community. The community doesn't seem to appreciate hearing about how a platform brings in millions of dollars in revenue and has decades of history. Is there a way to share experiences between the enterprise and open dev communities to benefit both? Learn about how to use humility and cooperation to fix things with the community, make your team stronger, and your customers more productive.

AT&T's Upstream Journey: Open Source within a Fortune 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T has seen an increase of 54x in commits, 10x in reviews, and 14x in drafted blueprints. Well over half of all contributions have come from a group consisting mostly of new hires. This effort began with three engineers and has since grown to thirty dedicated members in the first half of 2016. Most notably, these results have occurred within the walls of a Fortune 10, historically associated with conservative decisions rather than open source dedication. There is an absolute tide turning in the software culture at AT&T from all levels and it is to that of openness. The presenters in this talk are the original members of AT&T’s Community team. We have gone from fresh OpenStackers to taking on all steps required to contribute and grow the team by ten-fold. We have run the gambit on changing culture and breaking down roadblocks to enable open source efforts. We still have a long way to go, but we know our results and experiences can be invaluable to others in the community.

Does your voice count in OpenStack? Yes!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Working upstream and downstream is not easy. The upstream work can sometime make us lose the focus that we should always have on solving real user problems. In this talk we will cover how we slightly changed the way Red Hat’s OpenStack engineering teams, by including customer’s voice in a process.  Contributions are now part of an end-to-end delivery split of the work, cutting across traditional organizational lines. We use an approach similar to The Voice of the Customer (VOC) to capture customers’ requirements that are organized, sequenced in terms of relative importance and satisfaction with current alternatives. We will cover in detail, how we are encouraging the contributors to look at the product we are building, and the process we are using to build the product, while they are listening to the customer's voice, as if they were just behind them looking over their shoulders.

What we learned along the way: Internap's history with OpenStack and our plans for the future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In early 2014, Internap was at a crossroads: either we would continue writing, maintaining and supporting our internal cloud platform or we would find an alternative. While searching, we kept coming back to this intriguing, well-publicized and yet mysterious and growing community: OpenStack. It was so intriguing that we took the leap of faith and joined! But, being the newb on the block, we had a very long road unfolding ahead of us: how to adopt and embrace all the benefits of this new family. This is the story of our journey: from complete stranger, to enthusiastic user, to regular contributor and all the lessons we learned along the way.

Upgrading OpenStack Millennium Edition to OpenStack XP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every successful software company thrives when there’s a good mix of talented senior engineers and entry-level engineers. However, when today's curriculum focuses around AI and mobile development, it can be hard to find talented college students interested in cloud. Let's say you do find a new hire willing to jump into the vast unknown that is OpenStack; how do you take that engineer and bring them up in a fast-paced environment without overwhelming them and driving them away?  Attendees will walk away with the do's and don'ts for hiring and developing young talent from those who've gone through the process first hand. We'll talk about our experiences that include: starting out as new hires tasked with developing IBM's public cloud, joining a more experienced team (Blue Box), and taking on critical roles within the organization. We'll also discuss our experience recruiting and mentoring new hires and interns, giving them the tools and knowledge to succeed in the OpenStack environment.

Cloud and Corporate Culture Clash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

AT&T has experienced a shock to the way things have been done for years.  OpenStack is creating opportunities to evaluate and change slow manual processes that have existed for over a decade.  This presentation will show how OpenStack helped bring about change through the efforts to automate everything starting with design and deployment to sustainment and expansion.  We will explore the development of AIC Formation, a tool that reduced design from weeks to under 10 minutes.

Metrics: Friends or Enemies?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Measuring progress, effectiveness and success is a key in every organization from software development to services. The metrics are the same, and as always the devil is in the details. In an open source environment the different actors need to use the same set of numbers to form a meaningful set of KPIs. As the traditional processes and ways of working go through a transformation period to adjust to open source methods, it is crucial to have the same changes applied to metrics and how they are used to get the proper feedback loop. This presentation will go through the existing tools that provide measurements and describe the meaning of each. The presentation will also give an overview on how to use the values in an efficient way to become drivers of both business and development as opposed to a numbers' game.

OpenStack Operations by Design: An Approach to Integrated Operational Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many paths to the Cloud. Open projects and commercial distributions look at how to automate deployment and configuration of not only OpenStack but also DevOps tools to help with operations. In this session we propose the formation of an open cooperative project to offer a consistent way to extend OpenStack with tools that fulfil Operational capabilities & interfaces. It would cater to growing community of OpenStack operators worldwide and give them a common vehicle to interact and easily share artifacts. Commercial vendors would able to differentiate their products with advanced Ops capabilities. Tool providers would be attracted to contribute and integrate their offerings if they could consistently reach a larger user base. It is our intention to propose an extensibility model and show results from an initial prototype that bridges a well-known distribution (OpenStack-Ansible) and a well-known Ops monitoring tool (Nagios Core), and to explain how this model can be extended.

When we talk about the benefits of diversity, we frequently cite studies of companies like the 2009 UIC study concluding racial and gender diversity are associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, and greater relative profits.  A panel of company people leaders will bring this conversation down from the macro scale to discuss their personal experiences where building a diverse team has positively impacted product delivery and contributed to success.  These strong leaders will give advice on successfully finding and hiring talent to create a diverse team.  A report published in the Oct 2010 Science magazine showed a greater proportion of women in a group was associated with higher collective intelligence, defined as “the general ability of a group to perform a wide variety of tasks.”    Is it better to intentionally seek out and hire women to raise a team’s collective intelligence, or should diversity be encouraged organically by working to reduce bias in hiring?

Advanced Cloud Technology is here so look at People and Processes for Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sometimes it seems easy to implement a technical solution. IT gets a new project and eventually the business gets a new solution. Today we have the technology to deploy assets in seconds to minutes instead of days, weeks, and months; this means that business can be more innovative and have much greater market entry velocity than ever before. This all sounds great but even though the technology exists, that doesn’t mean that the business is designed to really take advantage of it and neither is IT usually.  The crux of the issue isn’t around technology; it is People and Process.  First off, the culture of the organization has to be ready for innovation at cloud-speed. Second, IT roles and skills need to be aligned with cloud capabilities and not with old time legacy latency. Third is Process, say this word over and over and it is still not enough because process defines automation  and orchestration, which is the cornerstone of cloud computing.

3 Peas in a POD – Accelerating Time to Value with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

To help promote the adoption of OpenStack and Private Cloud deployments, Intel created a sales tool called the SDI POD (Proof of Deployment) program. We consistently heard from our customers that they have seen our SDI OpenStack slideware before. They wanted proof that OpenStack was real and delivered the value we promised. We put our heads together and came up with a set of tools both hardware and software that demonstrates the power of OpenStack to our customers. In this session you will see how our “carry on”, “Cloud in a box” PODs (both Intel NUC, Xeon-D, and Xeon-E5 based) have been utilized to train, demonstrate, and prove the power of OpenStack. In conjunction with Cookbooks and Recipes,the value of the SDI POD program is the ability to show real business use cases running on OpenStack deployments. The SDI POD program helps accelerate the adoption of OpenStack by breaking down the “barriers of acceptance”, common in many organizations.
