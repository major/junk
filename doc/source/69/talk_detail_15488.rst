No Valid Host was Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sometimes we get “No valid host was found” error message in the scheduler logs when trying to create a volume in Cinder or create a share in Manila.  What does it mean?  In this session, we will explain how the scheduler chooses a host for volume and share placement in Cinder and Manila and how to debug the “No valid host was found” error message so that your volume/share creation becomes successful.  We will also be discussing about various filters and weighers options in Cinder and Manila.
