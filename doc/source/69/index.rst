Getting Started
===============

Keep Calm, And Use OpenStack Consistently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Why the heck do I need to know Cinder gives me volumes, or that Nova has something to do with compute? What is a Cloud Kitty? Fact, OpenStack public clouds today expose different versions to users. Just wait until you see the face on the application developer when she learns her application only works on some OpenStack clouds. In addition deployers of OpenStack clouds have to be aware of a big tent. What does that even mean? Which of the 50+ OpenStack projects do I need in order to be considered an OpenStack cloud? Join Mike Perez who is employed by the OpenStack Foundation, focusing on cross-project initiatives in the OpenStack project as he navigates through the open source tools available today for consumers, deployers and developers building and interacting with OpenStack public/private/hybrid clouds.

The Operators’ View on the Certified OpenStack Administrator Exam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack has become a sought-after skillset for IT professionals. Now, more than ever, employers are looking to certifications for validation to ensure that they are hiring the right skill sets from the marketplace. However, with the plethora of vendor-specific certifications, it is a challenge to determine which job candidates have the necessarily skills to operate OpenStack clouds. Enter the Certified OpenStack Administration (COA) program and exam: developed by a dozen companies from 10 countries who established a community working group to define skills and capabilities needed. The hands-on exam tests real ops skills, rather than delivering another paper certification. Hear from a panel of operators that have already passed the COA and get their perspective on how best to prepare for the exam. No, we won’t divulge the test questions, but attendees will receive sage advice from those who have achieved certification so that they can improve their chances of passing.

Oh! Oh! Oh! DEPLOY! DEPLOY! (aka Triple-O Deployment Model)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Every distribution seems to have their own OpenStack installer. Weighing the pros and cons of the different installers is a presentation of its own. In this session, we’re focusing on the TripleO installer.The TripleO deployment model utilizes OpenStack. This is sometimes confusing, but it can be disastrous if you accidentally do something in the wrong cloud. In this presentation, we will cover the basics of the TripleO deployment model and start to unravel the mysteries of the process where one cloud becomes two. We'll start by covering basic TripleO terminology and end with a review of the templates that are utilized by OpenStack to deploy OpenStack.

Introduction to OpenStack's Components Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack is the leading Open Source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform formed by more than 50 interrelated components, and understanding the inside of a component can be a daunting experience for new contributors.In this talk we'll have a look at the internal architecture of the main OpenStack components, showing their similarities and disparities, and the common Oslo libraries used, providing solid group for new contributors that start looking at the code. As part of the OpenStack ecosystem, these components are not isolated entities, so we'll briefly go over the communications between components as well. By following from end to end a complex flow requiring communication between components, and explaining the weakest points where things could go wrong, the importance of having this full picture will be shown. In this talk we'll not go over the conceptual architecture of OpenStack itself, or cover all the different components.

What is OpenStack ? The comprehensive answer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

"What is OpenStack ?" is easily the most common question we receive. And yet our most common answer still is "well, it's complicated". OpenStack is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Is it a common goal, a bunch of Python code, a single product, a set of disconnected projects, a job market, an interoperable standard, a community, a set of principles, a social experiment ? In this talk, Thierry Carrez, Director of Engineering at the OpenStack Foundation and chair of the OpenStack Technical Committee, draws on the past 6 years of academic research on that question to deliver the final, ultimate and complete answer.

OpenStack - so what is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you are knee-deep in a particular technology it is easy to forget that there is a world out there that is trying to get in, and quite often it's not an easy journey. I see this time and time again with OpenStack. It is a fast pace project that can add immense value to your business, but there's almost too much information out there to help people cut to the chase. In this talk I want to simply talk about what you need to know when looking to adopt OpenStack. I've been a customer researching OpenStack since the first release. I've been a contributor. I'm an author of several OpenStack books. I now help people get the best out of OpenStack at Rackspace.  I will cover 1) Understanding what is OpenStack 2) Help deciding whether OpenStack is a good fit for you and your business 3) Understanding what it takes to operate OpenStack I may or may not do karaoke at this one. Depends how the Disney law-suit is going from the last time I attempted it.

I don't take things too seriously, but I love helping people with OpenStack.)*

From Venti Lattes to Valet Parking: Wacky Analogies to Explain OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Trying to explain what you do (and why it matters) to friends at the bar, other parents at the PTA, or your relative? Does your new hire or intern truly get it? What about the CFO who has to sign a big check for services ... but really needs to wrap her head around what her company is buying first? We're here to help developers, salespeople and everyone who answers questions about OpenStack to better articulate what we offer, how it works, and how users can benefit. For example:  What's the difference between object storage and block storage? How does networking work in the cloud? Why do for-profit companies benefit from an open source project (and bother contributing back to it)? Both technical and non-technical people will benefit from this fun, irreverant and enlightening chat. We compare OpenStack and its services to everything from cake to valet parking in an effort to help everyone understand how OpenStack functions.

Feeling a bit deprecated? We are too. Let's work together to embrace the OpenStack Unified CLI!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Does anyone else recall learning the CLI of the OpenStack projects and scratching their head in bewilderment as to the variance in naming, structure, and arguments for the various projects? And then the output you received from executing the command was different depending on which project you were running against?Enter the OpenStack Unified CLI to level set these commands. The Unified CLI not only attempts to create a consistent feel between the OpenStack projects, it also is a pluggable architecture to dynamically provided commands, depending on which OpenStack components you had installed. For instance, you don't get OpenStack bare metal unless you have Ironic installed.In this session we will deep dive into the OpenStack Unified CLI. We’ll show how it works behind the scenes, and we’ll discuss its available plugins. We’ll also provide some troubleshooting guidance for those times when things don't work as expected.

From How-To to POC to Production: Learning By Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

One does not simply learn how to build production-grade OpenStack! The major distributions (and scripted installs like Devstack) have taken the guesswork out of getting OpenStack up and running. Gone are the days of spending days building your first OpenStack cloud using the how-to on openstack.org. But without this, how does one really learn the intricacies of OpenStack? And what happens when it's time to build your first production-grade cloud? A highly available OpenStack cloud consists of much more than just the big tent projects... numerous other open source applications are involved in making it work. And there's a gap in documentation between proof of concept and production creating a bigger leap than should exist. In this session we'll demonstrate what it takes to actually go from How-To to POC to production-grade OpenStack, filling in the gaps that exist and learning along the way.

No Valid Host was Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Sometimes we get “No valid host was found” error message in the scheduler logs when trying to create a volume in Cinder or create a share in Manila.  What does it mean?  In this session, we will explain how the scheduler chooses a host for volume and share placement in Cinder and Manila and how to debug the “No valid host was found” error message so that your volume/share creation becomes successful.  We will also be discussing about various filters and weighers options in Cinder and Manila.

Root Cause Analysis: Principles and Practice in OpenStack & beyond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A broad look at the field of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in the Cloud, in OpenStack, and beyond. The world of Cloud, and computing in general, is one of increasingly complex systems. With sophisticated algorithms and swift automation, we are able to develop systems (such as the Internet) that form the foundation of modern life. However, when these systems fail or suffer at times, their complexity becomes a barrier to getting to the root of the problem, understanding it and fixing it. Thus, there is a compelling need for partial and even full automation of Root Cause Analysis, a.k.a. RCA, in order to facilitate fault management. In this session we will examine the domain of RCA and address issues such as when should RCA be undertaken, and what are its goals. We will review various accepted methodologies for achieving efficient and effective fault management. We will then shift from this broad view and focus for the remainder of our talk on RCA in OpenStack.

Diary of a Wimpy Dev: Faking it as an Op
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For the last 6 months, an OpenStack developer has been building and managing not just the OpenStack source code but OpenStack itself. Looking up from a VM on his laptop, the OpenStack dev stumbled upon a few high-end rack servers, a few switches and router, and some power cords, and imagined a world unbounded by the limitations of a single piece of hardware. He dreamed of unlimited power and the adulation of his peers for building such a useful tool. So off he began on his quest to build a cloud for him and the masses. This talk follows the daily struggles of an OpenStack developer trying to deploy and use the very code they have created.

WTF is OoO: Owls All The Way Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The world is really a flat plate resting on the back of a giant tortoise and what is that turtle standing on? Why, it's turtles all the way down! TripleO is OWLS all the way down, a project aimed at installing, upgrading and operating OpenStack clouds using OpenStack’s own cloud facilities as the foundation - building on Nova, Ironic, Neutron and Heat to automate cloud management at datacenter scale. With TripleO, you start by creating an undercloud (an actual operator facing deployment cloud) that will contain the necessary OpenStack components to deploy and manage an overcloud (an actual tenant facing workload cloud). The overcloud is the deployed solution and can represent a cloud for any purpose (e.g. production, staging, test, etc). The operator can choose any of available Overcloud Roles (controller, compute, etc.) they want to deploy to the environment.

A glimpse of deploying OpenStack for the uninitiated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Creating an OpenStack environment is always an interesting journey and one created solely to be a test bed for new OpenStack features has its share of challenges. With the aim of repeated tear-down and recreation of OpenStack and an ‘Infrastructure as Code’ mindset with no prior sysadmin or OpenStack experience, using OpenStack components to deploy OpenStack was a fun goal to achieve. With multiple components and tools needed to deploy the Undercloud and the Cloud, this talk aims to share the experience of three developers creating a fast and easy deployment system and our learnings.

Bootstrapping a Cloud Devops team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Adding new members to any team can be difficult and time consuming but it’s a part of the daily life in any organization. To large Telco environments that deploy clouds for NFV there are new and unique methods, practices and training that need to be deeply ingrained in order to teach DevOps to every new team member. How do you create a brand new, bleeding edge training program and why spend the time doing so? Enabling developers and managers to quickly and effectivity ramp up and learn new technologies and be contributing team members is just as essential, if not more important than the everyday development activities that keep the lights on. We all know about the bus factor(how many people on your team does it take to get hit by a bus before you can’t deliver). How do we create a training program that tries to first get someone off the ground as a new hire and still have a flow for more seasoned DevOps veterans from other backgrounds and experiences?
