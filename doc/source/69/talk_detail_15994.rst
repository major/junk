WTF is OoO: Owls All The Way Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The world is really a flat plate resting on the back of a giant tortoise and what is that turtle standing on? Why, it's turtles all the way down! TripleO is OWLS all the way down, a project aimed at installing, upgrading and operating OpenStack clouds using OpenStack’s own cloud facilities as the foundation - building on Nova, Ironic, Neutron and Heat to automate cloud management at datacenter scale. With TripleO, you start by creating an undercloud (an actual operator facing deployment cloud) that will contain the necessary OpenStack components to deploy and manage an overcloud (an actual tenant facing workload cloud). The overcloud is the deployed solution and can represent a cloud for any purpose (e.g. production, staging, test, etc). The operator can choose any of available Overcloud Roles (controller, compute, etc.) they want to deploy to the environment.
