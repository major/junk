Bootstrapping a Cloud Devops team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Adding new members to any team can be difficult and time consuming but it’s a part of the daily life in any organization. To large Telco environments that deploy clouds for NFV there are new and unique methods, practices and training that need to be deeply ingrained in order to teach DevOps to every new team member. How do you create a brand new, bleeding edge training program and why spend the time doing so? Enabling developers and managers to quickly and effectivity ramp up and learn new technologies and be contributing team members is just as essential, if not more important than the everyday development activities that keep the lights on. We all know about the bus factor(how many people on your team does it take to get hit by a bus before you can’t deliver). How do we create a training program that tries to first get someone off the ground as a new hire and still have a flow for more seasoned DevOps veterans from other backgrounds and experiences?
