Keep Calm, And Use OpenStack Consistently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Why the heck do I need to know Cinder gives me volumes, or that Nova has something to do with compute? What is a Cloud Kitty? Fact, OpenStack public clouds today expose different versions to users. Just wait until you see the face on the application developer when she learns her application only works on some OpenStack clouds. In addition deployers of OpenStack clouds have to be aware of a big tent. What does that even mean? Which of the 50+ OpenStack projects do I need in order to be considered an OpenStack cloud? Join Mike Perez who is employed by the OpenStack Foundation, focusing on cross-project initiatives in the OpenStack project as he navigates through the open source tools available today for consumers, deployers and developers building and interacting with OpenStack public/private/hybrid clouds.
