Implementing your first production OpenStack compute cloud with Red Hat Consulting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When Rakuten Marketing selected Red Hat OpenStack as their compute platform, it was a great start to the project. But there are many choices and considerations in an effort this large, such as hardware, storage (ephemeral/block/object), network design, special network needs, and staffing. What went well? What did not go well? In this presentation, we’ll walk you through the effort and the results of an OpenStack implementation.
