OpenStack - so what is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

When you are knee-deep in a particular technology it is easy to forget that there is a world out there that is trying to get in, and quite often it's not an easy journey. I see this time and time again with OpenStack. It is a fast pace project that can add immense value to your business, but there's almost too much information out there to help people cut to the chase. In this talk I want to simply talk about what you need to know when looking to adopt OpenStack. I've been a customer researching OpenStack since the first release. I've been a contributor. I'm an author of several OpenStack books. I now help people get the best out of OpenStack at Rackspace.  I will cover 1) Understanding what is OpenStack 2) Help deciding whether OpenStack is a good fit for you and your business 3) Understanding what it takes to operate OpenStack I may or may not do karaoke at this one. Depends how the Disney law-suit is going from the last time I attempted it.

I've written a few books on OpenStack so it means I've very proficient in Word too.  I've been using OpenStack since the A release - I know, and I'm still here! I don't take things too seriously, but I love helping people with OpenStack.)*
