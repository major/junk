Behind the curtains - What Happens When Booting a Virtual Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A behind the scenes look at booting a virtual machine.  Examine what happens when a VM is launched and booted from Cinder volumes with Neutron ports and PCI-passthrough.  A great introduction to Nova and Neutron to help users understand what is happening and how different configuration changes impact the VM performance.  People working with OpenStack in production and developing on top of OpenStack would benefit from this talk to better understand how all the pieces come together to successfully deploy a virtual machine and how to troubleshoot problems when things go wrong.
