Working on OpenStack: My First Year in the Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Almost one year ago, I joined the Boston-based team at Tesora. Having no previous experience working hands-on with the OpenStack community, the past year has been a learning experience riddled with many challenges and triumphs. Tesora’s Database as a Service (DBaaS) Platform runs on OpenStack Trove, the OpenStack DBaaS offering.  I joined Tesora as a QA Engineer, and have learned many lessons over the past several months. This talk will highlight: The biggest challenges faced coming into the OpenStack community The challenges of navigating OpenStack documentation Making sense of a complicated software ecosystem Insight on the OpenStack community & how to become involved Whether it's attending my first Summit or diving head-first into OpenStack documentation, I've learned several important lessons to navigating the OpenStack community and believe others just starting out in their journey may benefit from a candid discussion.
