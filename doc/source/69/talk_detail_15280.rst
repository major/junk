Couch to OpenStack - Simplifying the Starter's Journey with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting started with OpenStack isn't always easy. It's ok to admin it, but there's no reason we can't fix it!  Together we walk through using the OpenStack Cookbook lab and other freely available resources to get you started on your journey to OpenStack.  We will level up ops admins, network admins, developers, and anyone from all areas to show you how to easily map your skills into OpenStack as you build a foundation of learning in a very simple to deploy home lab.  Hardware helps, but the sample lab deploys on VirtualBox on your laptop.  We will also illustrate some common use cases in a practial lab right in the live session!  Let's learn together!
