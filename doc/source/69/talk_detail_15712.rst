Diary of a Wimpy Dev: Faking it as an Op
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

For the last 6 months, an OpenStack developer has been building and managing not just the OpenStack source code but OpenStack itself. Looking up from a VM on his laptop, the OpenStack dev stumbled upon a few high-end rack servers, a few switches and router, and some power cords, and imagined a world unbounded by the limitations of a single piece of hardware. He dreamed of unlimited power and the adulation of his peers for building such a useful tool. So off he began on his quest to build a cloud for him and the masses. This talk follows the daily struggles of an OpenStack developer trying to deploy and use the very code they have created.
