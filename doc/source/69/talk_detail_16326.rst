A glimpse of deploying OpenStack for the uninitiated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Creating an OpenStack environment is always an interesting journey and one created solely to be a test bed for new OpenStack features has its share of challenges. With the aim of repeated tear-down and recreation of OpenStack and an ‘Infrastructure as Code’ mindset with no prior sysadmin or OpenStack experience, using OpenStack components to deploy OpenStack was a fun goal to achieve. With multiple components and tools needed to deploy the Undercloud and the Cloud, this talk aims to share the experience of three developers creating a fast and easy deployment system and our learnings.


* **Anup Navare** *(I am a recent college graduate from Santa Clara University, CA and joined Intel last year. I am an OpenStack developer working on enhancing Ironic features and improving the user experience in deploying OpenStack. I am very much interested in understanding and working on several usage models and use cases in OpenStack as well come up and demonstrate some cases where OpenStack is best suitable. )*
