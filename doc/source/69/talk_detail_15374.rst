What is OpenStack ? The comprehensive answer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

"What is OpenStack ?" is easily the most common question we receive. And yet our most common answer still is "well, it's complicated". OpenStack is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Is it a common goal, a bunch of Python code, a single product, a set of disconnected projects, a job market, an interoperable standard, a community, a set of principles, a social experiment ? In this talk, Thierry Carrez, Director of Engineering at the OpenStack Foundation and chair of the OpenStack Technical Committee, draws on the past 6 years of academic research on that question to deliver the final, ultimate and complete answer.
