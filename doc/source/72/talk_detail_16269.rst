Layer 3 Tunnel Support for Open vSwitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Advanced OpenStack cloud networking use cases such as L3-VPN overlays or Service Function Chaining and the corresponding interwork with standard network equipment require SDN vSwitches to support an increasing number of tunneling encapsulations such as MPLS over GRE, VXLAN-GPE, Geneve, NSH, and others to carry any type of payload. Traditionally, the Open vSwitch (OVS) is the de-facto standard SDN vSwitch for OpenStack only supported L2 tunnels. Together with the OVS community we are enhancing OVS to support tunnels that can handle arbitrary payload types, including MPLS, IP or NSH.
