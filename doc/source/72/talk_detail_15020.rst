Deployment of OpenStack Group Based Policy with Cisco ACI/APIC/ASA FW, and F5 LB in FSI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This use-case illustrates the integration of the GBP of OpenStack integrated with ACI/APIC, ASA FW, and F5 LB and demonstrates the benefits of ACI with OpenStack GBP and L4-7 Network services offloaded to ASA FW and F5 LB. The major enhancements implemented in this use-case include, but not limited to: Implemented an improved UI for automating networks provision in OpenStack. The conventional network structure are replaced with Network Containers, Network Security Domains, Application Profile Rules and Rule Sets, and L2/L3 Networks. Extended L4-7 external connectivity with integrating ASA FW and F5 LB. Implemented firewall service based on ASA FW, achieving FW rules management and external network and network group management. Implemented LBaaS based on F5 LB, achieving LBaaS policy configuration on F5 LB. This user-case demonstrated OpenStack integrated with a closed-loop network solution based on Cisco ACI/APIC/N9K, ASA FW and F5 LB is ready for FSI production environment.
