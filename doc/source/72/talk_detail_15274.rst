Load Balancing as a Service and Octavia, Newton and Beyond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Load balancing as a Service (LBaaS) has been one of the critical features asked for by cloud tenants. For the Newton release cloud providers such as Rackspace, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, etc. have partnered with the community and load balancer vendors such as Radware and A10 to enhance the new LBaaS v2 and Octavia services with improved reliability, security, and functionality.  We will be giving an update on the Active/Active work on Octavia as well as discussing the merge of LBaaSv2 and Octavia into a new proposed project called OpenStack LBaaS.

Nowadays you can find him annoying members of the OpenStack, specifically in the Octavia load balancer project, which he named.)*
