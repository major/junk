Firewall as a Service: Never Say Never Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) has experienced some rapid and extensive evolution in the Newton cycle.  A complete refactoring of the code joining FWaaS to the L3 agent, integration with the L2 agent, and the evolution of Neutron community standards have been significant challenges for the FWaaS team as implementation of the FWaaS v2 API spec has proceeded.  Hear from the FWaaS team about the challenges they have overcome, the current state of affairs, and the roadmap looking forward for Firewall as a Service.
