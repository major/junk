The good, bad, and ugly about Neutron Distributed Virtual Routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Neutron networking has traditionally offered limited scalability by routing all network requests through a dedicated network node.  With the arrival of DVR capability as part of Neutron, the ability to scale Openstack has now changed.  Out of the box, Neutron offers DVR as another option to scale Neutron networking while deploying Open vSwitch.   In our presentation, we discuss the change in architectural designs, how people can benefit from the change in Neutron, and a walk-through on how we can enable components in your OpenStack cloud to utilize these features without buying additional hardware.
