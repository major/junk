**Abstract:**

Presenters: David Levin, Midokura and Devdatta Kulkarni, PTL Solum, Rackspace Abstract:Industrial organizations facing fierce global competition are turning to cloud-based custom app development for their digital transformation. The technology enabler for the increasingly connected world is the network and custom software. Everything has to be built from the ground up in IOT because in the bleeding edge, there’s no commercial off the shelf solution. While Platform-as-Service helps abstract away much of the infrastructure, Devs still have to deal with network connectivity, in particular connecting VPCs between clouds, load balancing their applications and security policies.
