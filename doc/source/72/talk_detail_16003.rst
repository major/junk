Adapting your Networking Appliance to a world of Network Function Virtualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With service providers demanding scalable network infrastructure and much of the workloads moving to the cloud based virtual infrastructure, the network equipment providers has to cope with a new world of virtualized network function. To integrate with a virtual infrastructure just converting your network device to a virtual appliance is not enough. In this talk we will discuss the challenges of hosting a network appliance on OpenStack. Our discussion will involve the following parameters: Hardware requirements of a NFV (performance factors) Integration with cloud configuration system to provide a seamless movement of customer in to a virtual configuration interface. Deploying Multi-node VNF Scaling of virtual infrastructure Hooking up the network ports Network Ports configuration and trunking Clustering and HA in a virtual world.
