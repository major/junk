In-kernel Analytics and Tracing with eBPF for OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As the movement of applications from bare metal to the cloud continues, considerations around analytics and tracing are becoming more prevalent for security, monitoring, and accounting. As an open source project under the Linux Foundation, the IO Visor Project is working with the kernel community on extending BPF (eBPF) and is being used by many companies for security, tracing, and analytics. This talk will describe how an OpenStack micro-segmentation framework using eBPF can be utilized for analytics and tracing to secure application workloads. Use cases around application security, intrusion detection using service insertion, identity will be described. While networking is one piece of the solution, sandboxing applications to avoid attacks is also important. We will also touch upon how eBPF technology and a unified policy framework can secure application workloads in areas beyond networking.
