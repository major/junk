Network-diagnoser: A Distributed Health Monitor For Multi-tenant Network in DVR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Nowadays, Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) becomes more and more popular in overlay network deployment. With DVR, we can isolate the failure domain of network node and optimize network traffic by eliminating the centralized L3 agents. However, as its complicated implementation,  it is literally difficult to identify the root causes of faults on failure. Though there are various network monitoring frameworks for OpenStack, most of them don't work well with DVR mode. Network-diagnoser is a project for automatic network monitoring, troubleshooting and visualization, which makes it easy and efficient to resolve multi-tenant network issues, especially for DVR mode. It conisits of a centralized controller and several distributed agents. Network-diagnoser has been deployed in Qihoo production cloud and working steadily. It really makes our lives easiser.
