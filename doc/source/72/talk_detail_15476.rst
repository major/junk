~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

- Overview of China Mobile Public Cloud - Introduction of the 1000+ compute node deployment environment- Why China Mobile did not use stock Neutron - Why China Mobile finally deployed commercial SDN and NFV nodes in the Cloud - How China Mobile deployed 1000+ compute nodes with Nuage SDN and NFV in the field
