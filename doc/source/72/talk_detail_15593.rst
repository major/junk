Advanced Topics in OpenStack Networking: OpenFlow, OVS and Dragonflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack networking is in a constant state of change, innovation and improvement.  We see a proliferation of vendor implementations, each trying to solve performance, scale and features in a differentiating way.In this talk, we want to explore some advanced networking topics involving OVS and the OpenFlow protocol.  We will demonstrate some of the ideas using the OpenStack Dragonflow implementation, which utilizes OVS and OpenFlow:* Distributed Security Functions (Port Security, SG, FWaaS, VPNaaS, packet inspection)* Making the OpenFlow pipeline flexible* QoS* Applicative packet generation* Local controller reliability* HA* Load Balancing* NAT with Learning
