Neutron Power Vacuum

**Abstract:**

Scalability issues and a lack of features such as NFV support in Neutron has opened the field to many alternative Neutron plugin solutions. Many of these plugin alternatives are SDN solutions, and unlike many Openstack components, there are no clear favorites. Knowing which solutions best fit your environment can be difficult. This talk will give an generalized discussion of the SDN options and then provide some details on a representative set of solutions.
