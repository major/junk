Survey of Security Group Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session, we'll examine the behavior of four different Neutron security group configurations, so we can better understand their common behavior and where they differ. We'll examine the existing IPTables firewall driver in the Open vSwitch (OVS) and LinuxBridge contexts. We'll also look at the new OVS Firewall Driver and the firewall functionality in Open Virtual Network (OVN). All firewall drivers are responsible for anti-spoofing protection, so we also look at the behavior of the allowed-address pairs extension in each of these contexts.
