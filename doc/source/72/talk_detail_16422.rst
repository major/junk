The battle of the switches: Neutron with Open vSwitch versus Linux Bridge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge are two competing open source backends for OpenStack Neutron. While OVS is popular among both developers and users as shown in the latest OpenStack User Survey report, some operators have prior knowledge of Linux Bridge and are looking for a simple solution. In this session we would like to explore the two backends and try to address the key question: Which one’s for you? We will try to make it as objective as possible and stick to the facts - Which use cases are covered, where do features end up, who performs better, how big are the Neutron and Linux communities behind them, how does CI and test coverage look like, does the community push for a default via documentation and more. Objective facts aside, after years of direct contact with Red Hat’s customers and the OpenStack Neutron development community, we’ve formed a strong opinion and we won’t be afraid to share it.
