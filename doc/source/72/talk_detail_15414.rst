Deploying Policy-based vTap on Virtual Ports, Service Function Chains, and VNFs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As virtual networks grow with complex VNFs and service function chains, monitoring and troubleshooting can become unwieldy without analyzing packet flows and traffic patterns to diagnose network issues. While first generation vTap offered port mirroring type functionality, policy-based vTap is extending the capability to perform more intelligent data gathering that are defined by classification and action rules on flows and reverse flows. Â These rules can be applied at any point in a virtual network on virtual ports or any part of a service function chain including in between VNFs. Join this session for a deep dive on: Using vTap in a virtual network vTap policy classification and action rules vTap policy chain definitions Applying vTap in a service function chain
