Deploying IPv6 in OpenStack Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

More and more enterprise and service provider environments are deploying IPv6 due to extreme IPv4 address exhaustion.  IPv6 support in OpenStack has come a long way but has had serious gaps until the recent releases.  Now, production quality IPv6 deployment within the tenant domain can be fully realized. This session will discuss: IPv6 deployment options for the cloud provider IPv6 address assignment options within the tenant space to include: SLAAC, Stateless DHCPv6 and Stateful DHCPv6 Using IPv6 Prefix Delegation to reduce the burden of IPv6 address management for tenants IPv6 with L3 HA Dealing with limitations in IPv6-only tenant environments Detailed slides as well as lively demos will be used throughout the session.   This session differentiates itself from other competing sessions because it focuses on proven designs and deployment guidance. It supports the growing need to operationalize OpenStack to support emerging use cases and it is presented in a lively way. :-)
