A General Network Virtualization Solution for Hybrid Virtualization Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In order to manage diverse workloads running on cloud infrastructure, it is very common to deploy hybrid virtualization platform in cloud resiliant data center and a typical scenario is to deploy VMware for traditional enterprise applications and KVM for cloud native applications. As a result, the capability of managing hybrid virtualization is necessary in OpenStack to meet the requirements, not only the management of computing resources but also the connectivity of heterogeneous network architectures. In China Telecom, we formed a joint research group with Pica8 and AWcloud in China to tackle this problem by open technologies, like SDN controller, whitebox switch and software-based virtual router, etc. The platform is deployed in our national cloud computing laboratory. This integrated solution provides Layer 2 connectivity, tunnel optimization, high performance routing, visibility and reliability.Â Finally, we would love to share the architecture and details to the community.
