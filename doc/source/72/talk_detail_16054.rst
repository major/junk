Deploying ODL Containers as a Network Controller In OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenDaylight (ODL) is an open source network controller. It is a popular choice in its use as a layer 2 plugin for the Neutron network project and has been included in the big tent of Neutron plugins. In this presentation we will demonstate how to deploy an OpenDaylight Docker container that can be used in large deployments. This containered deployment solution for OpenDayLight and OpenStack can be used as a reference for other networking backend deployments as well.

While at Intel have worked with the OpenDaylight project and OpenStack. Recently, relocated to San Antonio to join the OpenStack Innovation Center, a joint venture between Intel and Rackspace. As a part of OSIC have worked in a large team of new upstream developers. Although still learning, have contributed largely to the Horizon and Neutron projects.)*
