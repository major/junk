Calico in the wild: Letting the cat out of the bag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Networking is interesting again. With a plethora of SDN solutions in the market, it can be intimidating to choose the right solution for your data center. Project Calico is the newest kid in the block with a simple premise of making your data center look and function like the internet. But can it deliver on the promise? Is it the right solution for you? Join us to find out. In this talk, we will give an introduction to Calico and discuss how it integrates with OpenStack and OpenShift (Kubernetes). We will also compare its approach with Openvswitch, discuss its gotchas and talk about its performance in the private and public clouds. At the end of this talk, an operator will be able to find out if Project Calico is ready for production for their use cases.
