Reshaping Network Services for the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the increase in number and scale of cloud deployments, more and more users find that existing network solutions fall short of meeting their demands.  This is true in many aspects: usability, customizability, application-orientation, and more.In this session we will cover aspects of software defined cloud networking that enable a new architecture for virtual network functions, which is suitable for the needs of large enterprise and telecom. We will focus on concrete implementations using the OpenStack Dragonflow project:* Service Chaining and Dynamic Topology Service Injection* Network Function as a Service (like Lambda functions)* Deployment Framework for VNFs* SDN-based design for VNFs with examples:- DHCP- Metadata service- IGMP
