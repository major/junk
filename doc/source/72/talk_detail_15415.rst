SDN Scale-out Testing at OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC), established by Intel and Rackspace, is created to accelerate adoption of open source cloud operating system while supporting open source principles. OSIC provides ready-to-use data center facilities to the OpenStack community for development and test.  This case study presentation highlights a scale-out test performed within a 3 week period using OpenStack Ansible Community based on Liberty with an SDN overlay network connecting 131 nodes running over 1,000 VMs. Tempest and Rally tests were conducted to validate functions including high availability failure scenarios. Join this session to find out more about OSIC and the SDN scale-out test configuration, scenarios, and results.
