Contrail as networking soultion for OpenStack and Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Providing secure, high-performance, SLA-compliant cloud services to multiple tenants in multiple locations with hybrid cloud topologies is nearly impossible to do with OpenStackâ€™s and Kubernetes default networking back-ends.Contrail can provide network micro-segmentation to kubernetes, with both network isolation as well as the ability to connect a pod to external networks interoperating existing network devices. Contrail SDN utilizes logical leaf-spine layout for added performance and resilience and BGP-based federation at the network edges for facilitating hybrid cloud connectivity. Bare-metal or VM-based deployments of Contrail lack the flexibility, portability and ease of scalability for hosts running SDN control plane components. On the other hand, containerized solutions provide huge benefits in cases of performance, scalability, portability and building microarchitectures.
