Networking approaches in a container world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Networking has always been a complicated and delicate topic. It is even more complicated in the world of containers, where huge numbers of containers are continuously created and respawned across entire data centers. There are several container networking choices available, each one with a different implementation and its own peculiarities. The different approaches taken by the different vendors to solve the container networking question can make it daunting to picking the right one for your environment. This talk reviews how the major Linux Container networking solutions work: their implementation details, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they influence the deployment of distributed applications in both container only environments and mixed VM - Container environments.


* **Antoni Segura Puimedon** *(Antoni serves as a core member of Openstack Kuryr and as the Container Team lead at Midokura and works on integrating MidoNet with VM and Container platforms. He has contibuted in the past to the networking stack of oVirt, Libvirt nova-docker and MidoNet. His recent focus has been on Container Software Defined Networking and Container projects like OpenStack Magnum and Mesosphere.)*

* **Flavio Castelli** *(Flavio Castelli is the engineering manager for the Containers team at SUSE. Flavio has been following Docker since its early days and focused on its integration within the openSUSE and SUSE ecosystems.Flavio developed experience in creating and managing systems while working on products such as SUSE Studio and SUSE Manager. Flavio is also a contributor to various open source projects.)*

* **Neil Jerram** *(Neil has been hacking on free software since the early 1990s, with contributions including to Emacs, Guile, Lilypond, QtMoko, the GTA04 phone project, oFono, FSO, OpenStack, Dnsmasq, Linux and Dasher. He's also worked for 20 years for Metaswitch (previously Data Connection) in the world of networking protocols, and happily those two strands of experience are now converged in Project Calico, an open source implementation of simple and massively scalable data center networking.)*
