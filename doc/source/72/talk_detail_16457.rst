VXLAN and BGP EVOLVE IN OPENSTACK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Why people curious and community take time in bgp? How to implement a high efficiency networking in OpenStack? How to achieve high availability and reduce MTTR & MTBR? You will get all these thing from presentation. Agenda: OVS VXLAN: Flood&Learn; BaGPipe: EVPN implemented by software; DVR: Neutron as the control plane; MP BGP EVPN: Industry VXLAN control plane; Networking-bgpvpn: DVR with BGP, Routed Network; BGP-EVPN-Advertisement: Bring DirectConnect to OpenStack?

Wei is also an actively open-source contributor, made contributions to buildbot and midonet. His blog is http://mytrix.me, where he wrote many articles about network, OpenStack Neutron, python, prolog and matlab. He lead a column which written by UnitedStack networking team, talk about openstack networking, neutron progress, ovn, dragonflow, fd.io, ovs, opendaylight and any other opensource networking project. http://bit.ly/29TIKIj)*
