BaGPipe: BGP VPNs to implement Neutron virtual networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

BaGPipe is a proposition to implement Neutron virtual networking by leveraging the BGP VPN toolbox to distribute virtual networking states.BGP VPNs have been proven as a robust, scalable and flexible solution to create isolated virtual networks over IP/MPLS backbones, and have been extended to support various encapsulations (VXLAN, MPLS/UDP, ...), and support both IP and Ethernet virtual networks. The later becoming a mature solution for datacenter fabrics.We propose to reuse Neutron's existing framework for DB persistency and messaging, and reuse AMQP messaging to push to agent the more static configuration changes, thereby offloading the more chatty virtual network state updates from the message bus to the BGP control plane.This is an alternative way of delivering a rich feature setÂ (e.g. BGPVPN interconnections, service-chaining), avoiding the addition of a full-blown SDN controllers and avoid the complexity of synchronising data between different persistency models.
