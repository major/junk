Openstack Networking with Neutron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The intention of the presentation is to give a birds-eye view of networking in Openstackbased on the "default" setup with Neutron/Openvswitch. It's mostly aimed at peoplefamiliar with network concepts, but not necessarily with deep Openstack experience.Concepts that will be talked about include: General Neutron design ML2 Openvswitch Overlay technologies like VXLAN and GRE Provider networks and Tenant networks Openstack routers, networks and subnets Security Groups Network Partitioning Network namespaces Floating IPs / NAT / PAT Address scopes and Subnet pools Neutron as a BGP speaker Distributed Virtual Routers HA routers L2 and L3 agents Plugins like for example VPNaaS and LBaaS DHCP and Metadata services
