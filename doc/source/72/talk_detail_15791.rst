IPv6 is Easy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Despite enjoying its 20th birthday in January, many engineers still find themselves intimidated by the apparent complexity of IPv6. Those that have tried often grew equally frustrated with vendor support leaving many deployments and business cases out in the cold. The good news is that light glimmers in the distance with worldwide user access to IPv6 climbing through 10% earlier this year. Services are attainable, applications (might) work and real users are connected. For the newly exposed, we will first cover the basics of IPv6, it's history, comparison to IPv4 and how it works. Those that are already familiar will enjoy a review of the changes made over the last decade. Does an RFC really require an entire /48 for each user and just how do you configure a DNS resolver anyway? Finally we will review the state of IPv6 support in major OpenStack components, what is coming in the future and ensure you are left with renewed energy to tackle your own IPv6 deployments with enthusiasm.
