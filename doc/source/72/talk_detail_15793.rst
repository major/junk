L2 gateway in a production environment - highly scaled, secured, seamless data and control path .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

It is heard that most of the cloud provider administrators find it difficult to configure openstack/networking-l2gw to bring legacy bare metal servers into cloud. This is because for the complete solution to work seamlessly, the administrator has to set the right configurations on the networking-l2gw side as well as on the switch side. It was also assumed that this solution is still experimental and was not made for the production quality.
