Neutron scalability test with 500+ compute nodes by China Mobile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Are there any problems with large scale deployment of OpenStack neutron? With scale of 500 compute nodes deployment using OpenStack neutron in China Mobile public cloud project,  we always have doubt about the issues such as: 1. Can neutron support such large scale? 2. Will Message Queue become a bottleneck? 3. How about the concurrent performance of neutron? 4. How to configure and deploy Message Queue and Database services? 5. If a node is down, how fast the agents can be recovered? With these questions in head, we did lots of scalability tests in order to find out the answers. In this session, we will share some test methods and how to optimize the performance in China Mobile public cloud project.
