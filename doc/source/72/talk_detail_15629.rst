Open vSwitch versus Linux bonding - the battle ends here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are many ways to configure OpenStack networking. With the mix of underlying hardware infrastructure, it is hard to determine and tune-up to achieve the best performance. The right networking configuration can provide a significant performance boost in many aspects of the infrastructure. It’s not just connectivity between two virtual machines, but speed of your software defined storage, access to upstream content, and management of the infrastructure.This session describes how to benchmark and tune-up many aspects of networking, including link aggregation, bridging, selection of hardware, and its accelerations. The use cases are host-to-host, software defined storage, infrastructure, and OpenStack.
