Unified networking for VMs and containers for Openstack and k8s using Calico and OVS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Mixing containers and VMs in one environment is difficult. Ongoing progress in containerization of services should be confronted with legacy use-case of enterprise workloads. It should be possible to stay opened to 'old-style' solutions and in the same time support latest trends in microservicing. The talk will present possible future of datacenter networking platform based on containerized Openstack environment run on Kubernetes cluster. The presentation will show architecture of co-located containers and VMs joined in common networking framework. To enable this, Neutron, Calico and OVS technologies will be explored. We will show how they can be configured to support unified networking. The evaluation of solutions existing on market will lead to assessment of current value and will show needed improvements to achieve common use-cases in both containers and VMs worlds. The requirements to fulfill are HA, multitenancy and exposing services to the Internet access.
