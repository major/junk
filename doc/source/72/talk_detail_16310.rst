Make Network Great Again: Third Party SDN for Everyone and OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Networking has been rather dull since the 1980s, it has been limited by old technological decisions that have made it difficult to scale in terms of addressing fundamental changes in Cloud Computing models. Layer 2 and lack of Progammability along with semi automated, and manual configuration simply cannot make the Network perform the tasks that we require in 2016. OpenStack is now mainstream, and many Availability Zones sit along with new emerging deployments of Containers, Public Cloud Services and Progammable Restful APIs that abstract much of the Network in code. This session will detail how the Network can be made great again by leveraging a single API and framework to cater to everyones needs, across Silos and beyond the OpenStack Neutron services - making the network great agaiin for everyone.

* **Christoph Torlinsky** *(Interested in all things OpenStack, Learning, Brainstorming, Contributing, all the usual...based in London, originally from Berlin, and lived and worked in San Francisco for a bit. I'm engaged across Europe for Nuage Networks, Presenting, Developing and generally spreading the word about Software Definition, all around Cloud Computing and also OpenStack itself. I travel alot, and also do Meetups locally in London and Germany, we probably have bumped into each other one or an OpenStack Day. Please see my LinkedIN for more details, been working on and using OpenStack in the field since 2013, before it became 'commercially' available from Linux vendors.   c)*
