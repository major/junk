Give your compute nodes superpowers with layer 3 open networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack networking with multiple tenants can cause a complicated infrastructure. This presentation contains two parts: 1) Implementing an all layer 3 VXLAN network topology all the way to the compute nodes, and 2) Using this concept to design a network where traffic flows are clear to understand, debug, and troubleshoot. Combining these concept with standard Linux DevOps tools (like Ansible and Git) and other open protocols, one can create a more agile and easy to debug network with better automation.
