Performance Analysis of Openstack Infrastructure using Collectd and Grafana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Understanding the performance of a cloud is a challenging task. That too with complex clouds like openstack, running myriad number of processes across a cluster of systems, is more complicated. In such situation, understanding the performance of each system, storage and network of openstack while optimizing them together would be a great option. A single user friendly customizable dashboard showing all the metrics would be very enticing for a cloud architect/operator. Extracting every bit of performance from the openstack cloud makes a lot of sense before any system upgrades are initiated. In this presentation and demo we focus on evaluating the performance of OpenStack infrastructure using open source tools like collectd and Grafana on a Dell cloud test-bed. Collectd and Grafana can be considered as the Swiss army knives of monitoring tools. Session aims to interactively explore the dashboard and the performance metrics produced by the openstack infrastructure using these tools.
