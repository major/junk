Hybrid Clouds?  Open vSwitch to the rescue!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Because in most organization there is not one single virtualization platform and not one single cloud, we need to make multiple worlds communicate together and integrate. During this session, we will discuss how Open vSwitch can be used on KVM, VMware, Hyper-V and Docker containers in a combined solution within and outside of OpenStack. We will then show how using to link in your existing envrionment and how this can all be extended out to AWS or Azure. All of that managed with Nuage Networks SDN and API, because you deserve DevOps now!
