Traffic Visibility with Virtual TAP and physical Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As core businesses moving to cloud continually, flow visibility is becoming more and more important. It is the foundation for network traffic monitor, trouble-shooting and security analytics. Now, there are some tools to steer traffic in community such as mirror, sflow/netflow, tap-as-a-service. However, these tools have some limitation (e.g, performance, deployment restriction).   Elastic Tap is a distributed, multi-tenant traffic probe that is deployed in vSwitch. It steers virtual traffic to off-the-shelf devices, where analytics is done. Elastic Tap has less negative performance impact on the switch because it is based on configurable policy. This presentation will discuss this Elastic Tap in detail.
