Building an efficient fast path for DVR routed networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In its current state DVR provides an efficient, distributed data path when used in conjunction with floating IP's. To enable that same fast path when directly routing tenant networks, we need to build on features such as address scopes, subnet service types, and BGP dynamic routing. In this session we will discuss how these features combined with DVR work together to enable a more complete distributed routing solution for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
