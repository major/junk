Troubleshooting Network Issues in Docker Networking Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Advanced Session on troubleshooting network issues in containerized cloud deployments. Focusing on issues such as a borken DHCP service, packet drops and other relevant network issues. Highlighting the required steps to troubleshoot neutron and related networking services. The session is based around several examples to show how troubleshooting can be done within a Neutron Environment (containerized or not). For example, we plan to show how to troubleshoot a DHCP issue by going through the compute host OVS architecture showing the expected flow, what key points to look at and how to find (and resolve) the issue.
