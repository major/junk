Interconnecting Neutron and network operators' BGP VPNs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The networking-bgpvpn Neutron stadium project allows to create connectivity between Neutron Ports, via their Networks and Routers, to BGP/MPLS VPNs. These VPNs are a cornerstone of telecom operators' backbones and interconnect datacenters, businesses or NFV POPs. Interconnecting them on-demand with Openstack is a critical piece of the NFV and hybrid cloud puzzles. This needs to be done in a controller-agnostic fashion to let automation and orchestration code be free of ties to a specific solution. The networking-bgpvpn project has been kickstarted in the Neutron stadium in 2015 to address this need.

Thomas is also active in the IETF, where he contributes to RFCs and co-chairs BESS, the working group defining evolutions of BGP VPN specifications. He has been focusing on network virtualization for IaaS since 2012 and contributes to related opensource projects, in particular in Openstack, where he co-leads the Neutron stadium BGP VPN project (networking-bgpvpn) and in OPNFV.)*

His background includes traditional hardware networking with a wide variety of vendors in WAN and datacenter environments as well as software development in C, Perl and Python. He is currently focused on AT&T's "Domain 2.0" initiative to virtualize large portions of the mobile/cellular and wireline data and VoIP infrastructure on top of a common OpenStack based cloud.)*
