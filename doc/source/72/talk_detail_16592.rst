Deploying Group Based Policy to Secure Microservices Running in OpenStack Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As microservices grow, traditional firewall rules based on network ACLs are no longer scalable and fall short of providing fine-grained enforcement. Group Based Policy (GBP) is a  flexible policy language that allows users to specify policy enforcement based on intent, independent of network infrastructure and IP addressing. Using micro-segmented virtual domains, administrators can define policies at a centralized location and use IO Visor technology for distributed enforcement. This provides infrastructure independent rules, template-based policy definitions, and scale-out policy enforcement for a solution that secures and scales with microservices.   The discussion will also cover using GBP for Cloud Foundry application spaces where microservices are deployed and need scalable, efficient security policies.
