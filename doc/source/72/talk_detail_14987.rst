Picking an OpenStack Networking solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack networking ecosystem is very rich with both open source and proprietarysolutions representing many different architectures to implement Neutron and networking services. What are the high level differences between the various open source solutions? What should you look forwhen picking a solution? Topics include L2/L3 gateways, L3 only networks, monitoring and debugging, containers, hybrid cloud, connecting legacy networks with new networks, NFV and service chaining, scaling, federation, and more.
