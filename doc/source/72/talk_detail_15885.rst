Challenges of DVR in a Large Scale Production Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) implementation provides the ability of each compute node to handle east-west / north-south traffic locally. For last couple of cycles, openstack community has spent a lot of effort on DVR to make it more robust and meet the industry needs. However, there are too few use cases of DVR in large-scale production cloud today. Since last year, Qihoo has introduced DVR into production cloud. In this session, we will talk about challenges we met and how we deal with it.  


* **Yong Zhang** *(Working on NAT/LVS in Qihoo 360 for 3 years, interest in network technology and introduce neutron into Qihoo's cloud since 2015.)*

* **Yufang Zhang** *(Yufang Zhang leads a team at Qihoo 360, who work on building one of the largest infrastructure based on OpenStack in China. His interest includes virtualization, SDN and system administration. Currently, he is also contributing to OpenStack in the form of patches and bug report. Before joining Qihoo 360, Yufang worked at Redhat as an engineer on virtualization. )*
