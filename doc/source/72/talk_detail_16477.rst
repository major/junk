Using Horizon & ML2 to Simplify TOR Switch Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The usual reason for writing an ML2 driver is to automate configuration of physical switches. But for Lenovoâ€™s typical OpenStack customers, improving ease-of-use is more important. Smaller-scale deployments with inexperienced operators are commonplace in our market. We will explain how we implemented two functions with big ease-of-use benefits: Mapping TOR switch ports to VMs inside Horizon; and automatic VLAN to VxLAN remapping
