Microservices vs Monoliths: How to make them communicate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

A lot of enterprises are now managing multiple stacks of VMs and Containers in their Datacenters. Openstack is typically used as the orchestration tool for the VMs, but on the Container side multiple orchestration tools now exist: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos, and new ones every other day! The painful questionÂ is how do you provide a common networking framework for your containers and your VMs ? This talk is going to explore real deployment use-cases in which both VMs and Containers are involved, and how Networking was solved seamlessly as one single stack.
