Deploying IPv6 in OpenStack TripleO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol standard. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed IPv6 primarily as a means to combat the exhaustion of IP address from the current common IPv4 standard. But IPv6 has lots of new features and advantages compared to the older protocol. In the context of OpenStack, IPv6 features let users choose to spawn instances on IPv6 only or via dual-stack, and it lets architects decide if underlying services should run via legacy IPv4 or via the new IPv6. Not all features are currently implemented for IPv6, and users and administrators alike will face challenges in IPv6 enabled clouds. Throughout this session, administrators will learn how to deploy overcloud services and Neutron tenant networks in OpenStack.
