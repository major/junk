The Fuel VMware DVS plugin in comparison to other networking VMware backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Many OpenStack users want to build hybrid clouds with both KVM and EXSi hypervisors -- and they must communicate with each other. The abundance of solutions for networking VMware backends can be confusing, so we will compare the Networking vSphere (VMware DVS) driver with others to provide enough information to make the right choice. This session covers: An overview of existing solutions, including: Nova-network Networking vSphere (OVSvApp) NSXv The Fuel plugin for VMware DVS The Networking vSphere (VMware DVS) driver A Demo of a deployed VMware DVS environment  Limitations, known issues and areas for future work The low latency, higher performing Networking vSphere (VMware DVS) solution, deployable with Fuel, is interesting for mid- and large size enterprises and telcos who are looking for an appropriate solution for their networking requests in vSphere-based or hybrid clouds as well as developers who are working on such solutions.
