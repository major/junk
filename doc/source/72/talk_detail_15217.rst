Service Function Chaining (SFC) with Neutron, CNI and CNM based VNFs using OpenContrail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Based on the type of virtualization different networking frameworks are used.OpenStack networking is based on Neutron, Docker uses the Container Networking Model (CNM)and Kubernetes, OpenShift and Mesos can use the Container Network Interface (CNI).The common denominator of the three frameworks is a plugin system for externalSoftware Defined Networking (SDN) drivers.In this session we will talk about the OpenContrail SDN controller providing drivers forall three frameworks. As part of the session we will demonstrate how the orchestration toolsand command line interfaces of the frameworks can be used to create Virtual Networks (VNs) andto interconnect Virtual Machines and Containers. We will show that VNs created with oneframework can be consumed by another framework. To show the full potential of the solutionwe will setup a Service Function Chain (SFC) with three Virtual Network Functions, each based on oneof the three frameworks and distributed across multiple hosts.

In HP he spent his last 2 years on doing research on SDN and writing applications unleashing the power of SDN. Michael is passionate about SDN and virtualization. As part of Junipers Contrail team he takes care for integrating OpenContrail into whatever kind of new and exciting technology comes along. Lately he started to enjoy the brave new world of Containers and their need for a robust networking infrastructure.)*
