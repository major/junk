VLAN Transparency support using the Neutron Open vSwitch ML2 mechanism driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

NFV service VMs often need to communicate over many tagged VLAN channels.   Support for transmitting VLAN tagged traffic across Neutron networks is only provided by certain Neutron plugins and ML2 mechanism drivers.   This talk will discuss the work being done to support “VLAN transparency” using the Neutron Open vSwitch ML2 mechanism driver and the support for QinQ in Open vSwitch.
