Integrating Containers with OpenStack Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This  talk examines how containers use the OpenStack networking in order to  be able to provide the containers with netwoking capabilities, and how  containers are different from VMs from a networking vantage point.  We  look at what the needs of container networks are, how those needs can be  achieved, and what trade-offs have to be made.  We will dive into some  specific container networking solutions, but the talk is primarily intended  to introduce people to the higher level techologies that container  networking uses, and what the future for container networking might  hold.  Only beginner-level  knowledge of networking will be assumed, and by the end of the talk you  should have a far better understanding of how OpenStack and container  networking works together.
