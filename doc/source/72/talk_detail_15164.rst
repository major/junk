Physical bug fix in a logical world: an approach to network root cause analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Cloud computing introduces a host of new troubleshooting challenges for the operator:Poor performance might stem from one of many unrelated issues, from CPU utilization to network congestion to physical network errors.Problems can be intermittent - there for your users, but not by the time you lookTracking problems from the virtual network env. to the physical network is very tricky.Whether private or public cloud, the need for rapid network fix is the same - get it done now! Yet the added complexity, moving parts and layers of an SDN greatly complicate the root cause analysis and bug fix. In this session we first outline the existing challenges faced by network operators in a cloud env. We then elaborate on the abilities built into MidoNet for solving some of the challenges. These new capabilities are supported by the Cumulus Linux platform and Broadcom Broadview, although in principle MidoNet tools work on any platform that provides the necessary information and interfaces

JR's early involvement in home-grown networking at Google and as the VP of System Architecture for Cisco's Unified Computing System both helped fine tune his perspective on networking for the modern datacenter.)*
