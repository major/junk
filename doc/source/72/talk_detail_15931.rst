Automatic network efficiency adjustment to optimize power saving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Energy - We all depend on it. But when it comes to your data center's scalability and operational expenses, we all try to reduce power consumption as much as possible. One of the biggest power consumers are the network elements. Network is a critical part of any cloud, but is it really working as efficient as possible? Especially when it comes to power efficiency?   In this talk we’ll describe a solution based on Watcher - a new OpenStack project that provides a flexible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds, and NEO: Mellanox Fabric orchestration and management tool. This solution enables to optimize network elements power consumption based on actual, real time cloud usage.
