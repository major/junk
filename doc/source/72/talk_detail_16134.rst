Network Orchestration for the Enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network virtualization is now becoming a standard practice in many data centers. The reality though is that many organization still rely on manual processes to manage their network infrastructure, since achieving reliable and scalable network automation, while ensuring carrier-grade considerations such as security, standards, and robustness is no simple feat. In this session, we will discuss how we can automate network operations through Openstack Neutron together with the rest of the application stack. We will also discuss how we can use network automation to actually increase network security, all while ensuring enterprise-grade standards are maintained.
