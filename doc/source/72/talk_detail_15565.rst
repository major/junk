Octavia Load Balancer as the last line of your cloud application defense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk is about turning on HTTPs handling in Octavia, the Open-Stack Load-Balancing as a Service. Octavia's Load-Balancer nodes can terminate the HTTPs connections at the Load-Balancer tier. It can improve your service performance by off-loading the TLS work from your back-end servers. It is required if you want to apply Octavia's L7 Load-balancing rules while using HTTPs. Cool!, so WHAT ARE THE ISSUES? (Q1) How much load is cause by TLS stuff? Answer: It depends.... but it may be significant (Q2) Can the Load-Balancer handle it? Answer: Usually not! -- you need ACTIVE-ACTIVE (Q3) Is it secure? Answer: Yes, but read the fine print... Follow-up questions: With Active-Active turned on several Load-Balancer nodes can handle the TLS load, but there is a new piece to the puzzle -- the Distributor. (Q4) Can the Distributor handle the load? Answer: Yes! (Q5) Is the Distributor secure? Answer: Yes, but read the fine print...
