Network abuse prevention using dynamic QoS enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network abuse and "noisy neighbor" is an issue that every public cloud provider faces. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how can we apply QoS to each NeutronÂ  to limit the network bandwidth per VM. We will further demonstrate how we can dynamically update the QoS policy for a running work load. We will also describe how our solution can be used to apply QoS policy with different rules to different tenants.
