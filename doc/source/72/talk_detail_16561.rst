Lessons learned enabling DPDK for an overlay-based SDN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

DPDK can offer many performance benefits, but inserting DPDK into an overlay-based SDN is non-trivial.Different SDN solutions have different constraints on integrations: design complexity, time, and cost restrictions are all part of the tradeoff matrix.Choices include selecting a proper adapting interface, and potentially using 3rd-party vendors, to address use cases where the open source DPDK integration is not sufficiently mature.We describe our experience integrating MidoNet with 6WIND, and show choices, tradeoffs, and final results obtained.Our goal is to extract and present generally applicable and useful lessons, for anyone planning a DPDK integration.
