Automatic Underlay Management in Rack scale Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Often, you need to create networks like VLANs while the cloud is deployed and functional. Instead of logging on to the switch CLI, manually creating them and adding to Openstack Neutron for allocation, you would like an automated SDI solution. In a Rack Scale Design pooled infrastructure management infrastructure, automated network creation via newly published network service APIs in Redfish, from the central controller, effectively showcases composition of networks and network services. With a programmable switch and management APIs to discover neighbors, we present a scalable framework to manage underlay networks.
