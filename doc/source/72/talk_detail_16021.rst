OpenStack At Hyperscale: Deploying On a Full-Mesh Routed Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This presentation will cover Clos networking architecture, also known as "Spine and Leaf", and presents an overview of deploying OpenStack in a fully routed network architecture. By utilizing the routing features present in most top-of-rack datacenter Ethernet switches, spine-and-leaf isolates broadcast domains and allows for horizontal scalability. Deploying OpenStack in a routed network environment requires knowledge of how OpenStack interacts with the network, and careful planning to ensure interoperability of components across routed subnets. Hyperscale architecture expands spine-and-leaf with a multi-dimensional spine. Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn use hyperscale architecture to maximize their capacity and throughput. While Hyperscale architecture is new to most Enterprise networks, the concepts behind spine-and-leaf networking are well established, and the technologies used are the same that you will find in any carrier-grade Internet service provider network.
