Deep Dive into VXLAN in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

With the development of the networking in OpenStack, more and more cloud architecutors are choosing VXLAN as overlay network. And, why VXLAN? VXLAN provides 16M tenant networks, better scalability and flexibility, failover with an L3 ECMP fabic, etc. In this summit, you will learn the history of VXLAN, how does it work, VXLAN network with MP-BGP EVPN Control Plane ,etc.
