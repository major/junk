Fits like LEGO: Building a cloud using Neutron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Openstack Neutron is like a Lego brick box for building, administering and monitoring virtual networks. Beginner users can easily understand Neutron’s basic building bricks, Port, Network and Subnet, to deploy a simple virtual network. However, when building a more complex private or public cloud, specialty bricks (e.g. router, floating-IP, security-groups, firewall) come into play. In my presentation, I will introduce the basic and specialty building bricks & how to use them to build five topologies: from a basic network topology all the way to the core block of multi-tenant self-service cloud. Each topology will be presented by its pros and cons, & how it fits other topologies in order to build an elaborated network structure.
