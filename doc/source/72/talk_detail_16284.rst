DVR:  Ready for Prime Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Neutron DVR feature was first introduced in Juno to address the performance bottleneck created by the centralized L3 service, identified in early public cloud deployments of OpenStack. Since then, the Neutron community has steadily increased its functionality, scalability, and performance. DVR is now widely deployed in production customer cloud environments. This session will provide an overview of DVR's current production use cases, high availability characteristics, and network performance benefits. Experiences from real customer deployments will be highlighted. In addition, we will be providing a status update on the latest upstream developments surrounding L3 and DVR. This includes optimizations to enable NS routing for fixed or dynamically routed IP traffic, support for multi-hypervisor deployments, and hardware L2 Gateway and bare metal support. We'll leave plenty of time for audience questions, so come prepared!
