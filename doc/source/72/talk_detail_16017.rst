Boosting OpenStack performance with OVS DPDK and OpenDayLight – performance benchmarking review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Networking Virtualization enhancements are required to meet CSP performance requirements. The introduction of a DPDK accelerated version of OVS and an OpenDaylight SDN Controller to OpenStack yields optimized packet processing and hence higher networking performance. A benchmarking lab we built was used to test the throughput gains contributed by the introduction of ODL and OVS DPDK.In this session we review the OpenStack Network Virtualization reference architecture, the benchmarking tests and the tested performance results.
