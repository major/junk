NetArbiter: Multi-site Network Stitching and Emulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In the AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC), distributed storage systems such as Ceph can be deployed over multiple sites to improve reliability and latency.  In order to deploy and test distributed storage systems in a geographically-dispersed cloud environment, we have built a framework for multi-site network stitching and emulation called NetArbiter. NetArbiter is able to bind different OpenStack clusters such that Virtual Machines (VMs) communicate with each other within a single private network domain. In addition, NetArbiter can emulate network delay and bandwidth between geographically distributed sites.  NetArbiter uses a DevOps tool named Ansible for ease of implementation and deployment.
