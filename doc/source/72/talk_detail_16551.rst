Network Policy Enforcement Based on Cloud Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this session we will introduce current segmentation technologies, highlight their limitations and show what would be required to tackle these. Current segmentation technologies have not been designed to be used in highly scalable, dynamic and on-demand environments such as cloud deployments. Also, current segmentation technologies do not provide the means to classify and isolate traffic based on cloud entities. Networks rely on identification approaches (IPs, port numbers, etc.) to apply policies, define forwarding decision, etc. Without cloud provider, service and tenant visbility on the network layer it is impossible to enforce fine-grained policies. In this session we will highlight a novel approach that takles current limitations, introduces Cloud specific identifiers and enables a multitude of critical use-cases and applications.
