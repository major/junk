From Neutron to Neutron: SDN-driven backbone traffic engineering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Several models for providing end-to-end traffic engineering between data-centers in carrier backbone networks through the interworking of Data-center(DC) and WAN SDN Controller will be presented. The model will enable seamless end-to-end service and traffic engineering from host to host and/or ToR to ToR across large National Service Provider backbones. A number of use-cases including the dynamic provisioning of virtual resources in Data Center as well as logical resources in transport network will be covered.  Options such as DC SDN Controller to WAN SDN Controller coupling with abstract Interface definition or extension of an unified control plane which spans the Datacenter and Backbone Networks will be discussed along with advantages and disadvantages of the options. The direct sharing of information, via standardized information models, between SDN Controllers will result in improvements in efficiency, flexibility and improved elasticity of resources for modern Carrier Networks.
