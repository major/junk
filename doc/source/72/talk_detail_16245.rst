Containers networking acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The use of Containers in OpenStack is growing, mostly around high performance work load such as NFV. While virtual machines networking stack evolved over time and offer many accelerations, Containers networking is significantly behind. Â In this talk we'd like to present a proposal to enable network adapters stateless offloads such as: Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and Transmit Side Scaling (TSS) Accelerated Receive Flow Steering (RFS Dedicated HW descriptor ring and buffers for receive and transmit with containers. During the talk we'll show how we allow the above offloads to apply for Container networking through exposing them for vEth devices. This includes RSS/TSS and aRFS for steering packet processing to each Container associated cores and as well as assigning dedicated HW receive and send queue and buffers for each Container, resulting with enhanced network performance for Containers through standard existing administration tools
