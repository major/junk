Practical Neutron: A Hands-On Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

In this lab, participants will use the Neutron APIs to create a secure, production-quality network stack, and then automate the entire process with Heat.  They will learn of common issues and error, what they mean, and how to resolve them.  By the end of this lab, participants will be able to: Leverage the Neutron APIs to instantiate routers and networks Associate VMs with the appropriate networks Secure VMs using security groups Verify proper routing and security Use Heat to automate the provisioning of an entire stack including networks, routers, security groups, and VM instantiation. Resolve common issues and errors.
