Next generation security and service chaining with NSX and Fortinet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Network and security architects are looking to operationalize OpenStack Neutron with more advanced service integration and manageability options. In general, service chaining has remained a challenge in Neutron, making it harder for security architects to deliver rich and secure topologies in an OpenStack-based private cloud. In this session we will discuss the integration options developed by VMware OpenStack Engineering in order to deliver next generation security and protection using the NSX platform and Fortinet’s FortiGate-VMX solution.
