OpenStack in production:  the challenge of SDN and lifecycle management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Running a production OpenStack cloud starts with a successful deployment, but the real challenges begin after you go live.  Integrating third party SDN solutions and software into an OpenStack cloud adds another layer of complexity to the environment.  One of the most vexing issues is ensuring that configurations are maintained across upgrades and updates of individual components.  Lifecycle management is a key requirement for a robust OpenStack deployment, enabling an operator to customize and maintain highly tailored environments.  During this session we will go through a few real-life examples of the approach we’ve taken with some of our most complex SDN use cases, including lessons learned and best practices.
