Routed (Calico) networking with ECMP, dual fabric planes and data/management separation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This talk will present how the Calico networking driver for Neutron was used in a recent OpenStack deployment with interesting requirements for ECMP through dual fabric planes, and for separate management and project data access into VMs, with Neutron security groups controlling the data access and an independent policy for the management access.

He's also worked for 20 years for Metaswitch (previously Data Connection) in the world of networking protocols, and happily those two strands of experience are now converged in Project Calico, an open source implementation of simple and massively scalable data center networking.)*
