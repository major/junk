Tenant Networks vs. Provider Networks in the Private Cloud Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack Neutron defines two major types of networks- tenant networks and provider networks. OpenStack administrators must decide what their Neutron network deployment strategy will leverage- tenant networks, provider networks or some combination of the two. This session will describe the unique challenges presented by tenant networks in the private cloud context and will build an argument for why shared provider networks may provide the best Neutron network deployment strategy for enterprise private clouds. This session will also discuss the rationale behind the assertion that network security is now orthogonal to network topology (which if true, is a significant factor leading to the viability of shared provider networks).
