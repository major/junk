L2 adjacency of KVM and Hyper-V cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

There are native applications (such as office 360) that needs to run on Microsoft supported Hypervisor platform for better efficiency. A windows shop will have majority of their production servers  running on Hyper-V platform, and their DevOps workload running on KVM cloud. Licensing and supportability implications of running Windows application servers on KVM hypervisor forces customer to deploy Hyper-V cloud along with the KVM cloud for their non- windows specific (such as Oracle database servers) application. Under such scenario, the VMs on KVM cloud cannot communicate to VMs on Hyper-V cloud over the secure VxLAN network.
