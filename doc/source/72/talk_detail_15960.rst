~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This is a guide by a newbie for newbies on how to add your networking solution to OpenStack. There are a massive number of current networking options in OpenStack. This session will provide an overview of where what happens in a number of diverse scenarios: libvirt, Nova, Neutron and the various plugins and controllers for different historical releases. A step-by-step guide will be presented on the pitfalls of adding a new network solution to OpenStack. There are hardcoded assumptions in core Nova/Neutron, workarounds will be presented. Topics covered include resource reservation, order of operations and minimizing change footprint. An example scenario with a new VIF and VNICs will be presented.
