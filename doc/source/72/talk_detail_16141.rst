Distributed Hardware routing, along with neutron routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Routing has always been challenge in OpenStack. One solution does not fit all situations, hence, many routing choices - such as Neutron HA router, DVR, Astara, and HW routing.  How does one decide which is the optimal for their deployment?  Many factors play in such as - complexity of deployment (and debugability) as in DVR, or scale issues as in Neutron router.  So, what is critical? - Scale or ease of deployment? What if you can have both?  Well, come in and listen to our presentation, where we will discuss how we take hardware based distributed routing, along with neturon routers to make the deployment simpler and highly scalable.
