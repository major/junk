Leveraging eXpress Data Path (XDP) for Programmable, High Performance Data Path in OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

eXpress Data Path, or XDP is an open source initiative driving high performance, programmable network data path in the kernel as part of the IO Visor Project. XDP is CPU and hardware agnostic with support for any higher layer applications that OpenStack operators may deploy.  Use cases include pre-stack processing such as filtering for mitigating DDoS attacks, packet forwarding and load balancing, flow sampling, monitoring and analytics just to name a few examples. XDP follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere", which enables XDP programs to run in Linux and other OS, with or without hardware offload, and support user space applications. Join this session to learn about this new initiative with contributions from companies such as Facebook, Huawei, PLUMgrid, Cisco, and more.

Since 2011, my team has designed and delivered crucial virtual networking technologies, for instance Elastic Virtual Switch(EVS) and S-DNA(Software-Defined Network Acceleration) framework, which have been the fundamental and differentiating building blocks of Huawei's Cloud, SDN, and NFV products and solutions. One of recent projects is Container-based Application Networking which will deliver high performance, application-to-application network monitoring, and network SLA.)*
