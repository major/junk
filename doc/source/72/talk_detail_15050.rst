Connect all the things: span multiple clouds and networks securely in 30 seconds or less
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Getting VMs connected across different regions in the same cloud can be challenging.  Getting VMs connected between two different clouds is harder.  Migrating an active workload from one cloud provider to another is tougher still, and borders on impossible without deep networking expertise.  Much of the same connectivity concerns exist just getting connected to VMs in a cloud without giving them all public IPs or using a bastion host. There's a simple open source VPN designed to solve these problems (and more), with minimal experience required to make full use of it.This presentation will cover the background and technology enabling this VPN, showcase some real-world use cases (like moving your app from AWS to an Openstack cloud, or controlling a beer brewing system from your phone), and will include a LIVE DEMO deploying zerotier and using it on VMs distributed across multiple providers.
