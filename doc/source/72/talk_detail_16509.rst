Providing Network Gateway Services in L2 VPN based Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Our network for development purpose provides L2 VPN among branch offices. Each division/team connects the Internet through their own routers, NAT and firewall devices. Costs of network hardware devices are expensive especially for small teams and usually, it takes a long time to purchasing hardware in corporations. To provide internet connectivity and NAT/FW functions in a fast and cost-effective way, we chose OpenStack to host virtual network instances. In this session, we will present the architecture of our deployment and lessons learned.
