OpenStack on the EGI Federated Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The EGI Federated Cloud is a multi-national cloud system that integrates institutional IaaS clouds into a scalable computing platform for data and/or compute driven applications and services. This infrastructure brings together more than 20 cloud providers, most of them deploying OpenStack, to support the computational needs of researchers all across Europe. EGI uses OpenStack to build a federation from a collection of independently operated deployments that are integrated with a set of core services to allow the interoperability with other cloud platforms. In this talk we will describe the EGI developments that extend OpenStack to build cloud federations for research and how OpenStack is deployed in the current production infrastructure of EGI. We will also highlight some of the use cases already taking profit of these resources.
