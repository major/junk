Bridging Parallel File Systems with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

At Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) there are many types of File Systems. LANL has Lustre, GPFS, NFS as well as various other file systems available. The management of all this data can be an onerous task. In many environments external to LANL, automatic tiering mechanisms are utilized to migrate data to other storage systems based on storage policies. LANL takes a different approach to data management. In our use case the user manages and migrates the data around manually using File Transfer Agents (FTAs). In this talk, I will discuss how LANL will use OpenStack to deploy and manage this type of cluster. I will go over motivations, as well as lessons learned, and advantages of this approach.
