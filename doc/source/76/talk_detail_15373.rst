Arrebol: easy and efficient execution of Bag-of-Task applications on federated clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

We present Arrebol, a service for the easy execution of Bag-of-tasks (BoT) applications in private, public and hybrid clouds. Arrebol provides an intuitive scripting language to define large BoT jobs in a succinct way. Using a command line interface, users can submit jobs to the Arrebol submission service. It parses the jobs and interacts with the underlying cloud to create the infrastructure required to run them. Then, it submits tasks to execute in parallel, and dismantles the infrastructure when it is no longer needed, making the management of the execution of jobs completely transparent to the users. BoT applications are ideally suited to be executed over elastic cloud infrastructures. We also discuss how Arrebol leverages Fogbow, a middleware for federating clouds, to increase the capacity of the infrastructure by exploiting different hybrid settings, including cloudbursting and cloud federation. Both Arrebol and Fogbow are available as open source under Apache 2.0 license.
