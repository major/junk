High Performance Computing - Ironically not just for baremetal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

High Performance Compute (HPC) environments are used across many different types of business and range in size from a handful of nodes to thousands of nodes. Some companies run their HPC in the public cloud, some run in in their own private cloud, and some have to do a mix of both. Monitoring and orchestrating the size of these clusters can be done using a cloud management platform (CMP). In this session, we will present a reference architecture that leverages several different products, including OpenStack and Ansible, to help monitor your HPC clusters and scale them up or down as the current load dictates. Since this is all open source and we all like choices, you can mix and match components into your final solution. Don't want to rely on Heat for software config? We'll let Ansible handle that. Don't want to worry about a different method for scaling each provider? We'll use a CMP, such as ManageIQ, to help decide which provider to use and orchestrate the actual deployment.
