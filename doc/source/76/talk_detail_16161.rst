Image is Everything: Dynamic HPC VM Repositories using Murano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As part of an effort to expand access to computing resources, the (US) National Science Foundation XSEDE project has funded several new computational resources with cloud provisioning capabilities – Bridges and JetStream. To facilitate sharing and reuse of scientific applications, an XSEDE Cloud Virtual Machine Repository has been proposed. Traditional delivery of applications involved monolithic images that requires development, construction, testing, maintenance, vetting, and cataloging of cloud virtual machine images which are non­trivial tasks. One solution is to use Murano, Heat, and cloud-init scripts to deliver scientific applications on a small number of generic images from Linux distribution maintainers rather than images. The use of standard OpenStack components makes the application repository usable by any standard OpenStack deployment. The details of construction, use, and highlights of a few selected applications will be covered.

Prior to returning to IU in 2012, he was the Director for Unix Systems and Security at a regional ISP for several years and was the CEO of a multi-store retail chain for ten years following that. Finding that technology was his true professional passion, he returned to IU, first working with small scale clusters and then with practical applications of cloud computing. As part of the Jetstream team, he contributes as the technical outreach lead to researchers and also as the author and librarian for the virtual machine featured images among other duties. He has learned enough about OpenStack to be well and truly dangerous and probably shouldn't have root on those systems.)*
