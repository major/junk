Realities at a National Lab -- Caring for your HPC Pets with a Cattle Prod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

OpenStack drives the promise of an HPC cluster manager integrated with in-house virtualization infrastructures. Except our expectations were immediately brought back to earth at the first attempt to integrate an Ironic-deployed cluster with existing infrastructure services. We, at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Laboratories, suffered with deployment tools and documentation written for cloud environments, not our own data centers and HPC workflows. We needed the cluster to integrate with high performance network infrastructures and shared parallel filesystems, and to be able to build the images without internet connectivity. Finally after streamlining our own processes, we have some pain-saving advice to share with the community. In this talk we review deployment tools such as Kolla and openstack-ansible, as well as image building tools for HPC clusters. We compare the tools with an eye toward flexibility, and whether they were able accommodate our environments. LA-UR-16-24899
