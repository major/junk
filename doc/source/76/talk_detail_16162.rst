Docker Storage Support for Reproducible and Secure Scientific Computing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Performing scientific computing in OpenStack clouds is enabling greater collaboration among researchers.  While this is enabling more science than ever before, there are still several storage challenges including application portability, multi-tenancy and performance.  By introducing Docker, scientists can create a single portable package that encompasses all of their application dependencies, allowing scientists to share their applciations. Docker also solves many storage challenges in a scientific cloud by itsolating tenants from each other while allowing their applications to come and go with no impact to the storage subsystem.
