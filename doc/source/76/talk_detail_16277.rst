Chameleon: Building a Computer Science Testbed with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

The Chameleon testbed provides a platform for computer science research. To support a wide range of repeatable experiments, it provides capabilities such as deep reconfigurability and exclusive resource access. These features are mainly implemented with OpenStack software, in particular Ironic for bare-metal deployment and Blazar for resource reservation. Chameleon went public in July 2015 and currently supports 800+ users as well as many exciting cloud computing research and education projects. This talk will present the internal architecture of Chameleon and especially how Nova, Ironic, and Blazar interact together to provide Chameleon's core capabilities. We will share our experience with running OpenStack and identify planned upstream developments that are important for Chameleon.
