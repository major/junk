InfiniCortex and InfiniCloud: Distributing scientific computing around the World.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

InfiniCloud is the worlds first native InfiniBand based OpenStack cloud operating at a global scale. Connecting High Performance Computing facilities across four continents, spanning Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. The system supports evolving models offollow the sun energy use. InfinCloud frees Compute and Data from the traditional Data Centre boundary, creating a pool of resources for users independent of physical location while maintaining data security and sovereignty. The system takes OpenStack to new levels of network performance operating at both 56Gb/s and 100Gb/s speeds with full RDMA and High Performance Computing InfiniBand interconnect capabilities.When combined with long range and routable InfiniBand a unique model of in-place data accesshas become a reality. In this presentation we cover the InfiniCloud architecture and some of the exlempar applicationswhich been successfully operated on the system.
