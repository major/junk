Clustered HPC and Big Data on-demand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

This session will teach you how you can use OpenStack, Heat, (and Ceph) to offer your users the ability to create complex, reproducible, extendible, clustered infrastructures, in minutes, at a push of a button. We call our approach Cluster-as-a-Service and we happen to use it for offering our users self-managed and fully monitored virtualized services like Hadoop, Spark, OpenStack, HPC, all in a as-a-Service manner. But you can use this, or a similar, approach for offering whatever you want.
