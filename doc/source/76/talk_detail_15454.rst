Neutron and SLURM: Software-defined Networking for HPC Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Los Alamos National Laboratory is continuing its work to enhance HPC with cloud technologies. The latest development is a SLURM plugin that allows the HPC resource manager to control a job's network access via Neutron. This plugin enables on-demand access to network resources and job segregation. I will describe how this plugin works and give a demonstration of its use. LA-UR-16-24835
