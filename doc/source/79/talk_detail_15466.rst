Big Data and Flash. This is your future!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Flash is enabling a new generation of large scale real-time applications. Many of the tried and true methods rules for deploying big data storage using HDD must be reexamined when brought into the flash world. This presentation will present alternative storage architectures for big data systems that exploit the advantages of flash technologies to provide vastly superior performant systems at cost levels that rival traditional solutions.
