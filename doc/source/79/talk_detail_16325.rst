Multitenant TensorFlow on OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Machine learning, deep learning and other fancy words make us all excited. However, the true challenge is to enable these techniques in production. How do we setup a system that works as a Service (aaS), is multi tenant and scales to offer the desired performance, taking advantage of OpenStack's components? At Cisco, we decided to do just that. After choosing TensorFlow to run our workloads, we want to share how we built a multitenancy service with TensorFlow and the many challenges we faced.
