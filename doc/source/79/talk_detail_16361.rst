Build a self healing Openstack cluster using Cognitive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Data driven applications on cloud infrastructure increasingly rely on Machine Learning. This often requires application developers and data scientists to write their own machine learning pipeline or deploy other packages to do some kind of data transformation and apply ML primitives. Data scientists also need to have an easy way to rapidly experiment with data without having to write basic infrastructure for the above operations. Often setting up data pipelines is the biggest barrier to rapid exploration of the design space and application development.  Cognitive is a ML service on top of OpenStack which provides ML based services to tenants (API, workbench, compute service).  In this talk, we present how you can use Cognitive to learn how to cluster activity from Openstack logs, obtain data insights and take corrective measures in realtime.  Openstack systems generate huge amounts of logs/metrics which can be fed into Cognitive for realtime predictive analytics and cluster tuning.
