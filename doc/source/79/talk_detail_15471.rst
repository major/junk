HDFS and Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Traditionally, Hadoop clusters have been built using dedicated hardware separated from the rest of the data center IT infrastructure. The rapid growth of HDFS/Hadoop/Spark/Yarn applications makes it desirable to share the services-oriented virtualized infrastructure commonly known as private cloud. While virtualizing compute and network interconnectivity is a relatively well-solved problem. Virtualizing the HDFS storage component into the private cloud work has unique challenges. This talk explores those challenges and offers multiple prescriptive solutions along with criteria to allow planners and architects to meaningfully compare and contrast the different approaches.
