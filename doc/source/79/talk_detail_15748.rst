Avoiding Datageddon: Ensuring availability as data growth multiplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

As organizations increasingly turn to OpenStack to build their cloud native applications, the amount of data generated is exponentially increasing as well. This data is more critical to organizations than ever, but ensuring its availability and preventing data loss is non-trivial due to this growth. Organizations are looking for scalable data protection and restoration solutions that can keep up with their data footprint. Come join us on this informative session where panelists will talk about do’s and don’ts for data protection on OpenStack, share real life experiences, debate various approaches, and discuss the relevance of Docker, SWIFT and much more.
