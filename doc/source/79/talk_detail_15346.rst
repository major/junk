Object Storage Analytics: Leveraging Cognitive Computing For Deriving Insights And Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Object storage has become a de facto cloud storage. Analytics over data stored on object store for deriving greater insights is an obvious exercise being looked by implementers. In object stores like SWIFT, user-defined metadata associated with objects has the ability to provide quick relevant insights of data and can be leveraged for analytics. But having relevant user defined metadata with every object is one of the inhibitors for such analytics. On the other hand, there are Cognitive Computing services that are now available which leverage extreme data analysis using machine learning techniques for data interpretation. In this presentation, we discuss how cognitive services can help enrich object stores for analytics by self-tagging objects which can be used for data analytics as well as for deriving object relationships. The presentation includes a manifestation of the above using on OpenStack SWIFT implementation and a popular cognitive service in marketplace like IBM Watson.
