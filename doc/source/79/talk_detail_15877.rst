Monasca-analytics: Sharing Tailored Data Analytics Tools for Monasca
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

Infrastructure management analytic challenges include root cause analysis, trends detection, custom overviews creation and anomaly detection. In Openstack this is repeated by every organization, causing work redundancy and suboptimal algorithms. Monasca-analytics is a new framework that extends Monasca, OpenStack Monitoring-as-a-Service project, with pluggable data science tools. Its features include: 1. Algorithmic flow definition: Enables sharing of complex algorithmic recipes in the community. 2. Thin orchestration layer: Uses the algorithmic flow and instantiates in an execution environment. 3. Execution engine independence: Support for Spark, with Flink in progress. Monasca Analytics can detect anomalies or reduce alert fatigue by analyzing large volumes of data; example algorithms 1-Class SVM, LiNGAM and statistics are provided. Algorithmic flow use cases will be demonstrated, showing how to achieve faster and better problem resolutions via community shared recipes.
