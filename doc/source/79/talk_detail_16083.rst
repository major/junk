MidoNet - Turn your overlay network "Insight Out"!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:**

MidoNet's MEM Insights data analytics gives cloud operators a better view into their virtual networks. MEM Insights analyzes and visualizes data including: Physical host tunnel traffic counters Virtual topology (routers, networks, ports) traffic counters Historical flow analysis Tenant bandwidth  usage Live flow tracing The session describes how operators can use the provided APIs to gain insight to virtual network  data. We will explain how we built our analytics platform using open source technologies like Elasticsearch and Logstash. By combining this data with additional network data extracted from the network virtualization overlay, thanks to the controller cluster's extensible architecture, operators can inspect their virtual traffic for any operational facets of interest.
